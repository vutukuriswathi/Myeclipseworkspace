Second, maybe he&apos;s not as charitable as he claims to be,&quot; she said.</p><p>How many truly undecided voters are swayed to one side or another will be fascinating to see as the more solid polls come out.</p><p>There were some reasonable polls from CNN yesterday that said Mrs Clinton won by 62-27 &#x2014; the third-largest winning debate.</p><p>Sometimes these debates can be decisive.</p><p>With high negatives on both candidates, it will be interesting to see whether this will shift the dial at all.</p><p>I suspect it will not make a huge difference, but I have been surprised a number of times in this campaign already.

</div><p> </p><p>Alongside roads and rubbish, animal management is a <a href="http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/pets/dogs/your-dogs-welfare-needs" class="externalLink">key function</a> of local government.</p><p>Animal management is a mixed bag of three distinct activities: education, compliance and enforcement. These are outlined in each local council&apos;s <a href="http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/pets/community-and-education/domestic-animal-management-plans" class="externalLink">domestic animal management plan</a>. </p><p>Such plans are of varying detail and importantly are just that: plans. What happens in practice may be very different.</p><p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40064-016-2843-8" class="externalLink">My recently published research</a> demonstrates that some activities are more effective than others in managing various common nuisances. </p><p>Understanding the effectiveness of animal management is really important: if we manage the nuisance of dogs well, then they are less trouble to the community and closer to being good canine citizens.</p><h4>Carrots and sticks</h4><p><a href="http://www.victorialawfoundation.org.au/sites/default/files/resources/Dogs_cats_neighbours_and_you.pdf" class="externalLink">Nuisance barking</a> is one of the most common complaints about dogs in the city. The <a href="http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/pets/dogs/training-and-behavioural-problems/barking" class="externalLink">general procedure</a> for resolving complaints is nevertheless quite successful in practice. This involves:</p><ul><li>complainant first raises problem with owner</li><li>if problem continues, complainant gathers evidence and reports to council</li><li>council requires owner to fix the problem</li><li>council and courts enforce the law as a last resort.</li></ul><p>That outcomes for each case differ does not appear to be too important to their overall success. The key to success in enforcement of animal management laws is consistency of process between cases and across councils.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/daa1994163/s26.html" class="externalLink">enforcement of effective control</a>, however, is a mess. There is no agreed definition of what this means &#x2014; among dog owners, officers, councils and the courts. This makes consistent enforcement nearly impossible.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/images/stories/committees/SCEI/Dogs_Inquiry/DOGS_report.pdf" class="externalLink">final report</a> of the Victorian government&apos;s recent inquiry into restricted&#x2011;breed dogs fails to define what &quot;effective control&quot; actually means, despite its central importance to the issue.</p><p><a href="http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/images/stories/committees/SCEI/Dogs_Inquiry/Subs/Submission_489_-_RSPCA.pdf#page9" class="externalLink">RSPCA Victoria</a> argues effective control is an owner&apos;s responsibility. My research supports this, finding that rather than being a tool of compliance, effective control is simply a part of everyday responsible dog ownership.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-16/charlie-and-tiger-fitt/7516414"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7516396-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Tiger Kiekebosh-Fitt sits with three year-old Labrador Charlie." title="Charlie and Tiger Fitt" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><h4>Going back to school</h4><p>Responsible dog ownership is a learned behaviour.</p><p>Schools are an excellent place to start teaching people about managing dogs.</p><p><a href="http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/pets/community-and-education/responsible-pet-ownership-for-children" class="externalLink">Public education for schoolchildren</a> is successful. In part, this is because of its focus on a particular demographic that is coincidentally pretty cheap for the government to reach. Schoolkids are a captive and receptive audience and love a visit from the dog-catcher with the friendly mutt.</p><p>As a bonus, the children then educate their parents on how to better interact with dogs.</p><p><a href="https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/218426/haz69.pdf" class="externalLink">Researchers from Monash University</a> have nevertheless called for an increased focus on adult education to reduce the rate of hospitalisation from dog bites.</p><p>Such education campaigns are easier said than done. This is because:</p><ul><li>they are expensive to run</li><li>they need to appeal to a very wide audience</li><li>they tend to focus on an individual species to the <a href="http://www.whosforcats.com.au/" class="externalLink">exclusion of others</a></li><li>they can take an inordinately long time, often bouncing from one government website to another as governments change, which makes material very hard to find.</li></ul><p>This all adds up to a weak message, which lacks bang for buck.</p><p>Public education campaigns that are privately sponsored may ultimately prove more successful. <a href="https://www.petpositives.com.au/" class="externalLink">Keep Australia Pet Friendly</a> is a great example. This tackles the trouble of dogs head-on with a message underscoring the net benefits of pet ownership for the community.</p><p>These campaigns may do so out of self-interest &#x2014; Pet Friendly campaign sponsor Mars Petcare Australia has some obvious skin in the game, for instance. But through a better reach and targeted message they will likely be more effective than similar government programs.</p><p>As dogs are increasingly recognised as having a genuine stake in our cities, we need to look for ways to encourage harmony between the species. Better animal management presents an obvious place to start.</p><div class="inline-content video full"> <a href="http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/news/video/201609/CNb_SurferDogs_2609_256k.mp4?type=video_onDemand&#x26;title=Video: Taking to the waves for California&#x27;s annual &#x27;Surf City Surf Dog&#x27; event (ABC News)"><strong>Video:</strong> Taking to the waves for California&apos;s annual &apos;Surf City Surf Dog&apos; event <span class="source">(ABC News)</span> </a></div><p> </p><p><strong><em>Simon Carter is a Research Fellow in Urban Planning at University of Melbourne.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Originally published in <a href="https://theconversation.com/we-need-a-better-understanding-of-how-we-manage-dogs-to-help-them-become-better-urban-citizens-64749" target="_self" title="" class="externalLink">The Conversation</a>.</em></strong></p>, tiny_mobile_url=, content_summary=[inline-photo, inline-video], first_create_date=2016-09-28 03:14:15, web_url=http://abc.net.au/news/7882000, attached_video=[], tiny_web_url=http://ab.co/2cAiGAO, extra=null, id=7882000, article_key=7882000.xml, byline=Simon Carter, University of Melbourne, updated=2016-09-28 03:14:15, status=Usable}

</div><p> </p><p>Alongside roads and rubbish, animal management is a <a href="http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/pets/dogs/your-dogs-welfare-needs" class="externalLink">key function</a> of local government.</p><p>Animal management is a mixed bag of three distinct activities: education, compliance and enforcement. These are outlined in each local council&apos;s <a href="http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/pets/community-and-education/domestic-animal-management-plans" class="externalLink">domestic animal management plan</a>. </p><p>Such plans are of varying detail and importantly are just that: plans. What happens in practice may be very different.</p><p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40064-016-2843-8" class="externalLink">My recently published research</a> demonstrates that some activities are more effective than others in managing various common nuisances. </p><p>Understanding the effectiveness of animal management is really important: if we manage the nuisance of dogs well, then they are less trouble to the community and closer to being good canine citizens.</p><h4>Carrots and sticks</h4><p><a href="http://www.victorialawfoundation.org.au/sites/default/files/resources/Dogs_cats_neighbours_and_you.pdf" class="externalLink">Nuisance barking</a> is one of the most common complaints about dogs in the city. The <a href="http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/pets/dogs/training-and-behavioural-problems/barking" class="externalLink">general procedure</a> for resolving complaints is nevertheless quite successful in practice. This involves:</p><ul><li>complainant first raises problem with owner</li><li>if problem continues, complainant gathers evidence and reports to council</li><li>council requires owner to fix the problem</li><li>council and courts enforce the law as a last resort.</li></ul><p>That outcomes for each case differ does not appear to be too important to their overall success. The key to success in enforcement of animal management laws is consistency of process between cases and across councils.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/daa1994163/s26.html" class="externalLink">enforcement of effective control</a>, however, is a mess. There is no agreed definition of what this means &#x2014; among dog owners, officers, councils and the courts. This makes consistent enforcement nearly impossible.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/images/stories/committees/SCEI/Dogs_Inquiry/DOGS_report.pdf" class="externalLink">final report</a> of the Victorian government&apos;s recent inquiry into restricted&#x2011;breed dogs fails to define what &quot;effective control&quot; actually means, despite its central importance to the issue.</p><p><a href="http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/images/stories/committees/SCEI/Dogs_Inquiry/Subs/Submission_489_-_RSPCA.pdf#page9" class="externalLink">RSPCA Victoria</a> argues effective control is an owner&apos;s responsibility. My research supports this, finding that rather than being a tool of compliance, effective control is simply a part of everyday responsible dog ownership.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-16/charlie-and-tiger-fitt/7516414"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7516396-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Tiger Kiekebosh-Fitt sits with three year-old Labrador Charlie." title="Charlie and Tiger Fitt" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><h4>Going back to school</h4><p>Responsible dog ownership is a learned behaviour.</p><p>Schools are an excellent place to start teaching people about managing dogs.</p><p><a href="http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/pets/community-and-education/responsible-pet-ownership-for-children" class="externalLink">Public education for schoolchildren</a> is successful. In part, this is because of its focus on a particular demographic that is coincidentally pretty cheap for the government to reach. Schoolkids are a captive and receptive audience and love a visit from the dog-catcher with the friendly mutt.</p><p>As a bonus, the children then educate their parents on how to better interact with dogs.</p><p><a href="https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/218426/haz69.pdf" class="externalLink">Researchers from Monash University</a> have nevertheless called for an increased focus on adult education to reduce the rate of hospitalisation from dog bites.</p><p>Such education campaigns are easier said than done. This is because:</p><ul><li>they are expensive to run</li><li>they need to appeal to a very wide audience</li><li>they tend to focus on an individual species to the <a href="http://www.whosforcats.com.au/" class="externalLink">exclusion of others</a></li><li>they can take an inordinately long time, often bouncing from one government website to another as governments change, which makes material very hard to find.</li></ul><p>This all adds up to a weak message, which lacks bang for buck.</p><p>Public education campaigns that are privately sponsored may ultimately prove more successful. <a href="https://www.petpositives.com.au/" class="externalLink">Keep Australia Pet Friendly</a> is a great example. This tackles the trouble of dogs head-on with a message underscoring the net benefits of pet ownership for the community.</p><p>These campaigns may do so out of self-interest &#x2014; Pet Friendly campaign sponsor Mars Petcare Australia has some obvious skin in the game, for instance. But through a better reach and targeted message they will likely be more effective than similar government programs.</p><p>As dogs are increasingly recognised as having a genuine stake in our cities, we need to look for ways to encourage harmony between the species. Better animal management presents an obvious place to start.</p><div class="inline-content video full"> <a href="http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/news/video/201609/CNb_SurferDogs_2609_256k.mp4?type=video_onDemand&#x26;title=Video: Taking to the waves for California&#x27;s annual &#x27;Surf City Surf Dog&#x27; event (ABC News)"><strong>Video:</strong> Taking to the waves for California&apos;s annual &apos;Surf City Surf Dog&apos; event <span class="source">(ABC News)</span> </a></div><p> </p><p><strong><em>Simon Carter is a Research Fellow in Urban Planning at University of Melbourne.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Originally published in <a href="https://theconversation.com/we-need-a-better-understanding-of-how-we-manage-dogs-to-help-them-become-better-urban-citizens-64749" target="_self" title="" class="externalLink">The Conversation</a>.</em></strong></p>, tiny_mobile_url:, content_summary:[inline-photo, inline-video], first_create_date:2016-09-28 03:14:15, web_url:http://abc.net.au/news/7882000, attached_video:[], tiny_web_url:http://ab.co/2cAiGAO, extra:null, id:7882000, article_key:7882000.xml, byline:Simon Carter, University of Melbourne, updated:2016-09-28 03:14:15, status:Usable]

Finally, Professor Sir William Penney, head of the UK Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, can wait no longer. He gives the final, definitive go-ahead.</p><p>The military personnel, scientists, technicians and media &#x2014; as well as the &quot;indoctrinee force&quot; of officers positioned close to the blast zone and required to report back on the effects of an atomic bomb up close &#x2014; tense in readiness.</p><p>And so, at 5pm, Operation Buffalo begins. The 15-kilotonne atomic device, the same explosive strength as the weapon dropped on Hiroshima 11 years earlier (although totally different in design), is bolted to a 30-metre steel tower.

</a></div><p> </p><h4>Power struggle</h4><p>So began the most damaging chapter in the history of British nuclear weapons testing in Australia. The UK had <a href="http://www.industry.gov.au/resource/Documents/radioactive_waste/RoyalCommissioninToBritishNucleartestsinAustraliaVol%201.pdf" class="externalLink">carried out atomic tests</a> in 1952 and 1956 at the Monte Bello Islands off Western Australia, and in 1953 at Emu Field north of Maralinga.</p><div class="inline-content infographic right"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/location-of-atomic-tests-in-australia/7880478"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/7880478/data/location-of-atomic-tests-in-australia-data.png" alt="" title="Location of atomic tests in Australia" width="340" height="307">

Australia&apos;s then prime minister, Robert Menzies, was all too happy to oblige. Back in September 1950 in a phone call with his British counterpart, Clement Attlee, he had said yes to nuclear testing without even referring the issue to his cabinet.</p><p>Menzies was not entirely blinded by his well-known anglophilia; he also saw advantages for Australia in granting Britain&apos;s request. He was seeking assurances of security in a post-Hiroshima, nuclear-armed world and he believed that working with the UK would provide guarantees of at least British protection, and probably US protection as well.</p><p>He was also exploring ways to power civilian Australia with atomic energy and &#x2014; whisper it &#x2014; even to buy an <a href="https://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/npr/walsh51.pdf" class="externalLink">atomic bomb with an Australian flag on it</a> (for more background, see <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/historical-journal/article/rethinking-the-joint-project-australias-bid-for-nuclear-weapons-19451960/DCE2FC212FCE7F81F5A6951B21357916" class="externalLink">here</a>). </p><p>While Australia had not been involved in developing either atomic weaponry or nuclear energy, she wanted in now. Menzies&apos; ambitions were such that he authorised offering more to the British than they requested.</p><p>While Australia was preparing to sign the Maralinga agreement, the supply minister, Howard Beale, wrote in a top-secret 1954 cabinet document:</p><blockquote><p>Although [the] UK had intimated that she was prepared to meet the full costs, Australia proposed that the principles of apportioning the expenses of the trial should be agreed whereby the cost of Australian personnel engaged on the preparation of the site, and of materials and equipment which could be recovered after the tests, should fall to Australia&apos;s account.</p></blockquote><p>Beale said that he did not want Australia to be a mere &quot;hewer of wood and drawer of water&quot; for the British, but a respected partner of high (though maybe not equal) standing with access to the knowledge generated from the atomic tests.</p><p>That hope was forlorn and unrealised. Australia duly hewed the wood and drew the water at Maralinga, and stood by while Britain&apos;s nuclear and military elite trashed a swathe of Australia&apos;s landscape and then, in the mid-1960s, promptly left. </p><p>Britain carried out a total of 12 major weapons tests in Australia: three at Monte Bello, two at Emu Field and seven at Maralinga.

At a dusty site called One Tree, in the northern reaches of the 3,200-square-kilometre Maralinga atomic weapons test range in outback South Australia, the winds have finally died down and the countdown begins.</p><p>The site has been on alert for more than two weeks, but the weather has constantly interfered with the plans. Finally, Professor Sir William Penney, head of the UK Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, can wait no longer. He gives the final, definitive go-ahead.</p><p>The military personnel, scientists, technicians and media &#x2014; as well as the &quot;indoctrinee force&quot; of officers positioned close to the blast zone and required to report back on the effects of an atomic bomb up close &#x2014; tense in readiness.</p><p>And so, at 5pm, Operation Buffalo begins. The 15-kilotonne atomic device, the same explosive strength as the weapon dropped on Hiroshima 11 years earlier (although totally different in design), is bolted to a 30-metre steel tower. The device is a plutonium warhead that will test Britain&apos;s &quot;Red Beard&quot; tactical nuclear weapon.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>The count reaches its finale &#x2014; three ... two ... one ... FLASH! &#x2014; and all present turn their backs. </p></blockquote><p>When given the order to turn back again, they see an awesome, rising fireball. Then Maralinga&apos;s first mushroom cloud begins to bloom over the plain.</p><p>By October the following year, there will have been six more.</p><p>RAF and RAAF aircraft prepare to fly through the billowing cloud to gather samples. The cloud rises much higher than predicted and, despite the delay, the winds are still unsuitable for atmospheric nuclear testing. The radioactive cloud heads due east, towards populated areas on Australia&apos;s east coast.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-21/one-tree/7865864"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7865396-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="One Tree" title="One Tree" width="340" height="227">

Australia&apos;s then prime minister, Robert Menzies, was all too happy to oblige. Back in September 1950 in a phone call with his British counterpart, Clement Attlee, he had said yes to nuclear testing without even referring the issue to his cabinet.</p><p>Menzies was not entirely blinded by his well-known anglophilia; he also saw advantages for Australia in granting Britain&apos;s request. He was seeking assurances of security in a post-Hiroshima, nuclear-armed world and he believed that working with the UK would provide guarantees of at least British protection, and probably US protection as well.</p><p>He was also exploring ways to power civilian Australia with atomic energy and &#x2014; whisper it &#x2014; even to buy an <a href="https://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/npr/walsh51.pdf" class="externalLink">atomic bomb with an Australian flag on it</a> (for more background, see <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/historical-journal/article/rethinking-the-joint-project-australias-bid-for-nuclear-weapons-19451960/DCE2FC212FCE7F81F5A6951B21357916" class="externalLink">here</a>). </p><p>While Australia had not been involved in developing either atomic weaponry or nuclear energy, she wanted in now. Menzies&apos; ambitions were such that he authorised offering more to the British than they requested.</p><p>While Australia was preparing to sign the Maralinga agreement, the supply minister, Howard Beale, wrote in a top-secret 1954 cabinet document:</p><blockquote><p>Although [the] UK had intimated that she was prepared to meet the full costs, Australia proposed that the principles of apportioning the expenses of the trial should be agreed whereby the cost of Australian personnel engaged on the preparation of the site, and of materials and equipment which could be recovered after the tests, should fall to Australia&apos;s account.</p></blockquote><p>Beale said that he did not want Australia to be a mere &quot;hewer of wood and drawer of water&quot; for the British, but a respected partner of high (though maybe not equal) standing with access to the knowledge generated from the atomic tests.</p><p>That hope was forlorn and unrealised. Australia duly hewed the wood and drew the water at Maralinga, and stood by while Britain&apos;s nuclear and military elite trashed a swathe of Australia&apos;s landscape and then, in the mid-1960s, promptly left. </p><p>Britain carried out a total of 12 major weapons tests in Australia: three at Monte Bello, two at Emu Field and seven at Maralinga. The British also conducted hundreds of so-called &quot;minor trials&quot;, including the highly damaging Vixen B radiological experiments, which scattered long-lived plutonium over a large area at Maralinga.</p><p>The British carried out two clean-up operations &#x2014; Operation Hercules in 1964 and Operation Brumby in 1967 &#x2014; both of which made the contamination problems worse.</p><h4>Legacy of damage</h4><p>The damage done to Indigenous people in the vicinity of all three test sites is immeasurable and included displacement, injury and death. </p><p>Service personnel from several countries, but particularly Britain and Australia, also suffered &#x2014; not least because of their continuing fight for the slightest recognition of the dangers they faced. </p><p>Many of the injuries and deaths allegedly caused by the British tests have not been formally linked to the operation, a source of ongoing distress for those involved.</p><p>The cost of the clean-up <a href="http://www.industry.gov.au/resource/Documents/radioactive_waste/martac_report.pdf" class="externalLink">exceeded $100 million</a> in the late 1990s.

Triple J&apos;s Hack looks at the numbers.</a></div>
</div><p> </p><p>There are two main approaches to surveying. One is a sampling of the population based on randomly generated telephone numbers. The other utilises an online panel of respondents who complete surveys out of interest and for reward.</p><p>Contrary to Hanson&apos;s claims, no-one was &quot;taking the call&quot; in the Essential survey: it utilised an online panel.</p><p>Surveys employing online panels are much cheaper and quicker to run. They have a proven record on a number of issues, notably predicting election outcomes, as over a period of years they develop weighting formulas for their panel calibrated against election results. But there are no formulas of the same level of precision when surveys deal with social issues.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.aapor.org/AAPOR_Main/media/MainSiteFiles/AAPOROnlinePanelsTFReportFinalRevised1.pdf" class="externalLink">extensive review</a> of online survey methodologies found that:</p><blockquote><p>Computer administration yields more reports of socially undesirable attitudes and behaviours than oral interviewing, but no evidence that directly demonstrates that the computer reports are more accurate.</p></blockquote><p>Major organisations seeking the highest level of reliability continue to employ random population sampling, despite the cost involved.</p><p>To test the impact of different methodologies, in 2014 the Scanlon Foundation <a href="http://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/134711/mapping-social-cohesion-national-report-2014.pdf" class="externalLink">administered the same questionnaire</a> to both a random sample of the population and an online panel. It found 44 per cent of Australia-born online panel respondents whose parents were born in Australia indicated they held &quot;very negative&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; views toward Muslims. The same demographic in the random sample had a much lower percentage (28 per cent).</p><p>There is a second issue, just as important, with the Essential finding.</p><p>Surveys do not simply identify a rock-solid public opinion; they explore, with the potential to distort through questions asked. Essential chose not to present respondents with a range of options on Muslim immigration. Rather, it was a yes/no choice:</p><blockquote><p>Would you support or oppose a ban on Muslim immigration to Australia?</p></blockquote><p>The product was easy-to-understand copy for the media, but arguably also a gross simplification. Public opinion on social issues defies binary categorisation. It is more accurately understood in terms of a continuum, with a middle ground on some issues in excess of half the population.</p><p>For example, <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/05%20About%20Parliament/54%20Parliamentary%20Depts/544%20Parliamentary%20Library/Pub_archive/Goot.pdf?la=en" class="externalLink">with regard to asylum seekers</a>, nine polls between 2001 and 2010 using various methodologies asked respondents if they favoured or opposed the turning back of boats. The average for these surveys was 67 per cent in favour of turnbacks.</p><p>But, in 2010, the Scanlon Foundation survey <a href="http://scanlonfoundation.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mapping-social-cohesion-summary-report-2010.pdf" class="externalLink">tested opinion on this topic</a> by offering four policy options, ranging from eligibility for permanent settlement to turning back of boats. In this context, a minority of just 27 per cent supported turnbacks.</p><h4>Minorities and Australian opinion</h4><p>Survey findings are typically considered in isolation in the media, with no understanding of context, of what is within the expected and what is beyond it.</p><p>The Essential survey of attitudes to Muslims is hardly the first in the field. Several random population samples since 2010 have found that when respondents are asked for attitudes to minorities, by far the highest level of negative opinion is towards Muslims.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/~/media/ResourceCentre/PublicationsandResources/Discrimination/LEAD-community-attitudes-survey.pdf" class="externalLink">2013 VicHealth survey</a>, 22 per cent of respondents indicated they were negative towards Muslims. This number was 22 per cent-26 per cent in six <a href="http://scanlonfoundation.org.au/research/surveys/" class="externalLink">Scanlon Foundation surveys</a> between 2010 and 2015.</p><p>A random population sample by <a href="http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/6507-australian-immigration-population-october-2015-201510200401" class="externalLink">Roy Morgan Research</a> in October 2015 asked respondents if they &quot;support or oppose Muslim immigration&quot;. It found a minority, 36 per cent, opposed; 55 per cent in support. Of Greens-voting respondents in the Morgan poll, just 1 per cent indicated they were opposed. This is a marked contrast with the Essential finding of 35 per cent.</p><div class="inline-content wysiwyg right">

<div class="inner"> <h2><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/half-of-australia-wants-muslim-ban/7865630" target="_self" title="">Muslim immigration poll</a></h2><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/half-of-australia-wants-muslim-ban/7865630" target="_self" title=""><img alt="" class="float--none" src="http://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/7880708/data/muslim-youth-wearing-a-flag-as-hijab-data.jpg"> </a> <br><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/half-of-australia-wants-muslim-ban/7865630" target="_self" title="">Polling in September 2016 found that 49 per cent of people support a ban on Muslims coming to Australia. Triple J&apos;s Hack looks at the numbers.</a></div>
</div><p> </p><p>There are two main approaches to surveying. One is a sampling of the population based on randomly generated telephone numbers. The other utilises an online panel of respondents who complete surveys out of interest and for reward.</p><p>Contrary to Hanson&apos;s claims, no-one was &quot;taking the call&quot; in the Essential survey: it utilised an online panel.</p><p>Surveys employing online panels are much cheaper and quicker to run. They have a proven record on a number of issues, notably predicting election outcomes, as over a period of years they develop weighting formulas for their panel calibrated against election results. But there are no formulas of the same level of precision when surveys deal with social issues.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.aapor.org/AAPOR_Main/media/MainSiteFiles/AAPOROnlinePanelsTFReportFinalRevised1.pdf" class="externalLink">extensive review</a> of online survey methodologies found that:</p><blockquote><p>Computer administration yields more reports of socially undesirable attitudes and behaviours than oral interviewing, but no evidence that directly demonstrates that the computer reports are more accurate.</p></blockquote><p>Major organisations seeking the highest level of reliability continue to employ random population sampling, despite the cost involved.</p><p>To test the impact of different methodologies, in 2014 the Scanlon Foundation <a href="http://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/134711/mapping-social-cohesion-national-report-2014.pdf" class="externalLink">administered the same questionnaire</a> to both a random sample of the population and an online panel. It found 44 per cent of Australia-born online panel respondents whose parents were born in Australia indicated they held &quot;very negative&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; views toward Muslims. The same demographic in the random sample had a much lower percentage (28 per cent).</p><p>There is a second issue, just as important, with the Essential finding.</p><p>Surveys do not simply identify a rock-solid public opinion; they explore, with the potential to distort through questions asked. Essential chose not to present respondents with a range of options on Muslim immigration. Rather, it was a yes/no choice:</p><blockquote><p>Would you support or oppose a ban on Muslim immigration to Australia?</p></blockquote><p>The product was easy-to-understand copy for the media, but arguably also a gross simplification. Public opinion on social issues defies binary categorisation. It is more accurately understood in terms of a continuum, with a middle ground on some issues in excess of half the population.</p><p>For example, <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/05%20About%20Parliament/54%20Parliamentary%20Depts/544%20Parliamentary%20Library/Pub_archive/Goot.pdf?la=en" class="externalLink">with regard to asylum seekers</a>, nine polls between 2001 and 2010 using various methodologies asked respondents if they favoured or opposed the turning back of boats. The average for these surveys was 67 per cent in favour of turnbacks.</p><p>But, in 2010, the Scanlon Foundation survey <a href="http://scanlonfoundation.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mapping-social-cohesion-summary-report-2010.pdf" class="externalLink">tested opinion on this topic</a> by offering four policy options, ranging from eligibility for permanent settlement to turning back of boats. In this context, a minority of just 27 per cent supported turnbacks.</p><h4>Minorities and Australian opinion</h4><p>Survey findings are typically considered in isolation in the media, with no understanding of context, of what is within the expected and what is beyond it.</p><p>The Essential survey of attitudes to Muslims is hardly the first in the field. Several random population samples since 2010 have found that when respondents are asked for attitudes to minorities, by far the highest level of negative opinion is towards Muslims.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/~/media/ResourceCentre/PublicationsandResources/Discrimination/LEAD-community-attitudes-survey.pdf" class="externalLink">2013 VicHealth survey</a>, 22 per cent of respondents indicated they were negative towards Muslims. This number was 22 per cent-26 per cent in six <a href="http://scanlonfoundation.org.au/research/surveys/" class="externalLink">Scanlon Foundation surveys</a> between 2010 and 2015.</p><p>A random population sample by <a href="http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/6507-australian-immigration-population-october-2015-201510200401" class="externalLink">Roy Morgan Research</a> in October 2015 asked respondents if they &quot;support or oppose Muslim immigration&quot;. It found a minority, 36 per cent, opposed; 55 per cent in support. Of Greens-voting respondents in the Morgan poll, just 1 per cent indicated they were opposed. This is a marked contrast with the Essential finding of 35 per cent.</p><div class="inline-content wysiwyg right">

Formed in 2006 after the merger of the Australian Retirement Fund (ARF) and the Superannuation Trust of Australia (STA), AustralianSuper has a long history of investment in infrastructure.</p><p>Long-term ARF and STA trustee (and former ACTU secretary) Bill Kelty is a particular advocate of infrastructure investment. As AustralianSuper CEO Ian Silk acknowledges, much of AustralianSuper&apos;s investment success can be ascribed to <a href="http://www.unsworks.unsw.edu.au/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=UNSWORKS&#x26;docId=unsworks_12592" class="externalLink">Kelty&apos;s emphasis on infrastructure</a>.</p><p>Pairing up with AustralianSuper is IFM Investors. Managing more than $72 billion worth of infrastructure assets, the fund is the country&apos;s leading player in the infrastructure sector.</p><p>IFM was formed in 2004 (as Industry Funds Management) and is the successor to the Development Australia Fund (DAF). It is owned by 29 industry superannuation funds and <a href="https://theconversation.com/www.oecd.org/pensions/pensionfundinfrastructureaustraliacanada2013.pdf" class="externalLink">invests on a global scale</a>.</p><p>DAF was launched in 1991 by the ACTU in collaboration with the AMP Society and the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers. Chaired by Ian Court, the head of Cbus (the building and construction industry superannuation fund), DAF led the push of the industry funds into infrastructure investment. </p><p>On behalf of the industry funds, <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22media/pressrel/1OK20%22" class="externalLink">DAF partnered with AMP in the privatisation</a> of airports, purchased toll road companies and invested in the renewable energy sector.</p><p>Like other businesses owned by the industry funds, IFM is run on a cut-price &quot;all profits to members&quot; basis.</p><p>It buys up infrastructure assets on behalf of the industry funds, allowing their millions of members to profit from government privatisations.</p><h4>Super funds leading infrastructure investment</h4><p>The Canadians have only recently cottoned on to the idea that investment in airports, shipping terminals and electricity assets is ideal for retirement-savings schemes.</p><p>Members of superannuation funds expect their nest eggs to grow over the 30 years or more of their working lives. Infrastructure investments match long term financial returns with the long term investment horizon needed by a pension or superannuation fund.</p><div class="inline-content video right"> <a href="http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/news/730/video/201608/730s_CarrSales_1108_256k.mp4?type=video_onDemand&#x26;title=Video: Former Foreign Minister Bob Carr says the decision sends mixed signals to China.

Provided they get these, they are content and happy.</p><p>Since then our four chickens became three: our large Sussex, Big Bertha, literally fell off the perch a few months ago. The surviving ladies - Helen D. Chook, Princess Layer and Hen Solo - missed their lost coop-mate, but they simply got on with the everyday business of living.</p><p>In that article I yearned for political conversations going beyond the subsistence needs of the chookyard, offering a higher vision of where we are going as a nation and a community. I feared then these were beyond either Malcolm Turnbull&apos;s Coalition or Bill Shorten&apos;s Labor. Looking at the Opposition&apos;s approach to the start of an election year, I wrote:</p><blockquote><p>Labor&apos;s current pitch boils down to &quot;the Coalition is taking away your chickenfeed - be it Medicare, welfare or (insert issue here) - help us stop them.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>As it turned out, Labor rode that very tactic to the verge of a dramatic, unexpected, boilover victory destroying Turnbull&apos;s parliamentary majority and personal authority. Very, very cleverly, Labor persuaded many voters the Coalition would privatise Medicare because the Coalition had prior form: the Abbott government&apos;s attempt to impose a mandatory $7 GP co-payment.</p><p>That the GP co-payment (for which I take responsibility for first advocating and therefore helping plant the fateful seed of the Medi-scare), and subsequent measures like Turnbull&apos;s intended changes to pathology and radiology bulk-billing incentives, were intended to make Medicare more sustainable, and not deprive people of access to affordable health care when they need it, was buried by Labor as an inconvenient truth.</p><p>However dishonest its claims were, Labor&apos;s relentlessly-pressed message that the choice was, as Shorten put it, between &quot;Malcolm or Medicare&quot;, meant enough voters in the seats that mattered chose Medicare and put this election on the knife edge it is.</p><p>The Prime Minister acknowledged as much this week when he finally emerged from his bunker to confront realities he denied in his angry election night speech:</p><blockquote><p>This was a shocking lie, I&apos;m not going to pretend it&apos;s anything else. But the fact that significant numbers of people believed it or at least believed it enough to change their vote, tells us that we have work to do and we are committed to that.</p><p>That is a very clear lesson. We have to do more to reaffirm the faith of the Australian people in our commitment to health and to Medicare.</p></blockquote><p>That people accepted their untruth, and wanted to believe it, shouldn&apos;t be held against Labor strategists. Chookyard politics prevailed this election, and Labor merely exploited its insight that chook-like dependency on government as the Great Provider runs through the Australian electorate&apos;s psyche.</p><p>Conversely, Turnbull didn&apos;t understand that vaguely grand visions, like his economic plan based on company rather than personal tax cuts, frighten those who feel they will lose what they have come to depend upon. Just ask those defeated Liberal MPs.</p><p>Saturday&apos;s result is about subsistence - hence Labor&apos;s devastating Medi-scare. Shorten and his Labor advisers brilliantly read the mood of the electorate where the Coalition lost most seats - western Sydney, Tasmania and coastal Queensland - far better than did Turnbull and his campaign team. They got inside those voters&apos; heads.</p><p>If we want to be treated like chooks, we get the politics we deserve.</p><p>Whoever of Turnbull and Shorten heads a government when the dust settles, voters consequently have made sure the next term of parliament will be dominated by chookyard issues: health, education, welfare, public safety. The electorate is demanding these be well-funded, and doesn&apos;t seem to care where the money&apos;s coming from. Any attempt to reform or reduce those services, or increase families&apos; shares of the costs, will meet not only with electoral wrath, but the wrath of the fractious, ferocious, populist Senate that we appear to have installed.</p><p>A tragedy for good, reformist policy is that Turnbull&apos;s failure to win this election outright not only has diminished him and his authority as Prime Minister - should he hold on. It ensures chookyard politics will trump the politics of the greater good for the immediate future, perhaps longer. As I wrote in January:</p><blockquote><p>Too often we chooks either take the electoral bribes enticing us back into our coops, or reject positive change threatening our cosy little worlds.</p></blockquote><p>This sums up what happened on Saturday, and the Coalition brains trust didn&apos;t get it.</p><p>If he is to survive in the tough new political environment he has created for himself, Turnbull needs to escape his posh Wentworth electorate comfort zone and go out into outer suburban and regional communities, mix regularly with ordinary Australians from all walks of life, genuinely learn about their lives and prove he truly understands, as he put it yesterday, that:</p><blockquote><p>It&apos;s about 24 million Australians. It&apos;s about their dreams, their aspirations, their families, their sense of security, their anxieties about the future, about government services, whether they can keep their job, whether they will get a better job.</p></blockquote><p>Whether Turnbull can acquire a fraction of the intuitive ability of Bob Hawke, John Howard and Tony Abbott to get inside Australians&apos; minds, and understand what they think and want, will determine if he rises from the ruins of his disastrous, misguided and misjudged campaign.</p><p>Either that or he should take up keeping chickens.</p><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/terry-barnes/3760374" target="_self" title=""><em>Terry Barnes</em></a><em> is a policy consultant, former senior Howard government adviser and has written a weekly column for The Drum.

Provided they get these, they are content and happy.</p><p>Since then our four chickens became three: our large Sussex, Big Bertha, literally fell off the perch a few months ago. The surviving ladies - Helen D. Chook, Princess Layer and Hen Solo - missed their lost coop-mate, but they simply got on with the everyday business of living.</p><p>In that article I yearned for political conversations going beyond the subsistence needs of the chookyard, offering a higher vision of where we are going as a nation and a community. I feared then these were beyond either Malcolm Turnbull&apos;s Coalition or Bill Shorten&apos;s Labor. Looking at the Opposition&apos;s approach to the start of an election year, I wrote:</p><blockquote><p>Labor&apos;s current pitch boils down to &quot;the Coalition is taking away your chickenfeed - be it Medicare, welfare or (insert issue here) - help us stop them.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>As it turned out, Labor rode that very tactic to the verge of a dramatic, unexpected, boilover victory destroying Turnbull&apos;s parliamentary majority and personal authority. Very, very cleverly, Labor persuaded many voters the Coalition would privatise Medicare because the Coalition had prior form: the Abbott government&apos;s attempt to impose a mandatory $7 GP co-payment.</p><p>That the GP co-payment (for which I take responsibility for first advocating and therefore helping plant the fateful seed of the Medi-scare), and subsequent measures like Turnbull&apos;s intended changes to pathology and radiology bulk-billing incentives, were intended to make Medicare more sustainable, and not deprive people of access to affordable health care when they need it, was buried by Labor as an inconvenient truth.</p><p>However dishonest its claims were, Labor&apos;s relentlessly-pressed message that the choice was, as Shorten put it, between &quot;Malcolm or Medicare&quot;, meant enough voters in the seats that mattered chose Medicare and put this election on the knife edge it is.</p><p>The Prime Minister acknowledged as much this week when he finally emerged from his bunker to confront realities he denied in his angry election night speech:</p><blockquote><p>This was a shocking lie, I&apos;m not going to pretend it&apos;s anything else. But the fact that significant numbers of people believed it or at least believed it enough to change their vote, tells us that we have work to do and we are committed to that.</p><p>That is a very clear lesson. We have to do more to reaffirm the faith of the Australian people in our commitment to health and to Medicare.</p></blockquote><p>That people accepted their untruth, and wanted to believe it, shouldn&apos;t be held against Labor strategists. Chookyard politics prevailed this election, and Labor merely exploited its insight that chook-like dependency on government as the Great Provider runs through the Australian electorate&apos;s psyche.</p><p>Conversely, Turnbull didn&apos;t understand that vaguely grand visions, like his economic plan based on company rather than personal tax cuts, frighten those who feel they will lose what they have come to depend upon. Just ask those defeated Liberal MPs.</p><p>Saturday&apos;s result is about subsistence - hence Labor&apos;s devastating Medi-scare. Shorten and his Labor advisers brilliantly read the mood of the electorate where the Coalition lost most seats - western Sydney, Tasmania and coastal Queensland - far better than did Turnbull and his campaign team. They got inside those voters&apos; heads.</p><p>If we want to be treated like chooks, we get the politics we deserve.</p><p>Whoever of Turnbull and Shorten heads a government when the dust settles, voters consequently have made sure the next term of parliament will be dominated by chookyard issues: health, education, welfare, public safety. The electorate is demanding these be well-funded, and doesn&apos;t seem to care where the money&apos;s coming from. Any attempt to reform or reduce those services, or increase families&apos; shares of the costs, will meet not only with electoral wrath, but the wrath of the fractious, ferocious, populist Senate that we appear to have installed.</p><p>A tragedy for good, reformist policy is that Turnbull&apos;s failure to win this election outright not only has diminished him and his authority as Prime Minister - should he hold on. It ensures chookyard politics will trump the politics of the greater good for the immediate future, perhaps longer. As I wrote in January:</p><blockquote><p>Too often we chooks either take the electoral bribes enticing us back into our coops, or reject positive change threatening our cosy little worlds.</p></blockquote><p>This sums up what happened on Saturday, and the Coalition brains trust didn&apos;t get it.</p><p>If he is to survive in the tough new political environment he has created for himself, Turnbull needs to escape his posh Wentworth electorate comfort zone and go out into outer suburban and regional communities, mix regularly with ordinary Australians from all walks of life, genuinely learn about their lives and prove he truly understands, as he put it yesterday, that:</p><blockquote><p>It&apos;s about 24 million Australians. It&apos;s about their dreams, their aspirations, their families, their sense of security, their anxieties about the future, about government services, whether they can keep their job, whether they will get a better job.</p></blockquote><p>Whether Turnbull can acquire a fraction of the intuitive ability of Bob Hawke, John Howard and Tony Abbott to get inside Australians&apos; minds, and understand what they think and want, will determine if he rises from the ruins of his disastrous, misguided and misjudged campaign.</p><p>Either that or he should take up keeping chickens.</p><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/terry-barnes/3760374" target="_self" title=""><em>Terry Barnes</em></a><em> is a policy consultant, former senior Howard government adviser and has written a weekly column for The Drum.

Theories don&apos;t carry the weight they once did, writes Greg Jericho.</em></strong></p><p>Who knew telling voters that economic theory would deliver good times no longer had the same potency it once did? Well, everyone it would seem, except the Liberal Party.</p><p>First we watched the Canadian election last year, in which a government very much of the &quot;austerity pain is for your own good&quot; school of economics was ousted. Then there was the Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders phenomena in the US, with its mix of racism and xenophobia from Trump and anti-free trade deals from both he and Sanders. And most recently we witnessed the Brexit vote in the UK, which went against all advice from economic experts.</p><p>Having sized them all up, Australian voters said: &quot;Me too.&quot;</p><p>The phenomenon is not a new one. It&apos;s been happening since the 1980s and the great dislocation caused by economic rationalism.</p><p>Back in that decade <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDYGlDV4ldo" class="externalLink">Sting wrote in a song</a> about the end of the UK coal industry:</p><blockquote><p>This place has changed for good/ Your economic theory said it would/ It&apos;s hard for us to understand/ We can&apos;t give up our jobs the way we should.</p></blockquote><p>Maybe now political parties are twigging that people are getting sick of hearing about &quot;transition&quot; and talking of a vibrant new economy. Certainly the Liberal Party should be realising that now.</p><p>Among the biggest lessons of this campaign is that basing your entire campaign on the budget is stupid, and having that budget&apos;s big ticket item be a company tax is just stupid repeated.</p><p>There&apos;s a reason every media organisation runs a &quot;winners and losers&quot; column the day after the budget - all most people care about when it comes to budgets is the impact on their income. In that sense, although budgets cover every portfolio they are a very narrow aspect of life.</p><div class="inline-content right"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDYGlDV4ldo" class="externalLink"><span><strong>External Link:</strong> Sting - We work the black seam</span> </a></div><p> </p><p>Starting the election campaign with a budget meant the Government had that very narrow focus on what constituted people&apos;s lives.</p><p>Yes it fed into the Liberal Party&apos;s slogan of &quot;jobs and growth&quot;, but what would be those jobs and who would achieve that growth never really connected.</p><p>It was someone&apos;s job, and growth for someone, but unless you were agile, tech minded and possibly about to begin a start-up company that made use of the China free-trade agreement, then that someone seemed to be somebody else.</p><p>The sales pitch for the company tax cut was itself a classic of the neo-liberal-macroeconomic-trumps-all genre. There was talk about GDP and GNI improvement, foreign investment, productivity improvements and then employment and wages growth.</p><p>Well, sort of.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.treasury.gov.au/PublicationsAndMedia/Publications/2016/Modelling-for-2016-17-budget" target="_self" title="" class="externalLink">Government&apos;s own modelling to support the company tax cut</a> revealed that were the rate to be cut to 25 per cent, then employment <em>in the long-run</em> would be improved by (drum roll) 0.1 per cent.</p><p>What a shock voters didn&apos;t take to the streets in celebration.</p><p>Malcolm Turnbull didn&apos;t really help himself either. He <a href="http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/doorstop-interview-with-assistant-minister-angus-taylor-and-russell-matheso" target="_self" title="" class="externalLink">told the media in May</a> that:</p><blockquote><p>One thing we know for sure is that when you cut business taxes, company taxes, the value of that, the benefit flows back into the economy and overwhelmingly goes back to workers, to labour.</p></blockquote><p>Now that is how things are expected to work, but it sounds very much like a trickledown economics view. Being told that giving a tax cut to someone else will eventually flow through to more income for you requires voters to have a lot of faith.</p><p>He also liked to cite the Treasury modelling that he argued showed that &quot;for every dollar cut in company tax $4 of value created in the overall economy.&quot;</p><p>Well yeah, but you don&apos;t eat GDP.

Theories don&apos;t carry the weight they once did, writes Greg Jericho.</em></strong></p><p>Who knew telling voters that economic theory would deliver good times no longer had the same potency it once did? Well, everyone it would seem, except the Liberal Party.</p><p>First we watched the Canadian election last year, in which a government very much of the &quot;austerity pain is for your own good&quot; school of economics was ousted. Then there was the Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders phenomena in the US, with its mix of racism and xenophobia from Trump and anti-free trade deals from both he and Sanders. And most recently we witnessed the Brexit vote in the UK, which went against all advice from economic experts.</p><p>Having sized them all up, Australian voters said: &quot;Me too.&quot;</p><p>The phenomenon is not a new one. It&apos;s been happening since the 1980s and the great dislocation caused by economic rationalism.</p><p>Back in that decade <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDYGlDV4ldo" class="externalLink">Sting wrote in a song</a> about the end of the UK coal industry:</p><blockquote><p>This place has changed for good/ Your economic theory said it would/ It&apos;s hard for us to understand/ We can&apos;t give up our jobs the way we should.</p></blockquote><p>Maybe now political parties are twigging that people are getting sick of hearing about &quot;transition&quot; and talking of a vibrant new economy. Certainly the Liberal Party should be realising that now.</p><p>Among the biggest lessons of this campaign is that basing your entire campaign on the budget is stupid, and having that budget&apos;s big ticket item be a company tax is just stupid repeated.</p><p>There&apos;s a reason every media organisation runs a &quot;winners and losers&quot; column the day after the budget - all most people care about when it comes to budgets is the impact on their income. In that sense, although budgets cover every portfolio they are a very narrow aspect of life.</p><div class="inline-content right"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDYGlDV4ldo" class="externalLink"><span><strong>External Link:</strong> Sting - We work the black seam</span> </a></div><p> </p><p>Starting the election campaign with a budget meant the Government had that very narrow focus on what constituted people&apos;s lives.</p><p>Yes it fed into the Liberal Party&apos;s slogan of &quot;jobs and growth&quot;, but what would be those jobs and who would achieve that growth never really connected.</p><p>It was someone&apos;s job, and growth for someone, but unless you were agile, tech minded and possibly about to begin a start-up company that made use of the China free-trade agreement, then that someone seemed to be somebody else.</p><p>The sales pitch for the company tax cut was itself a classic of the neo-liberal-macroeconomic-trumps-all genre. There was talk about GDP and GNI improvement, foreign investment, productivity improvements and then employment and wages growth.</p><p>Well, sort of.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.treasury.gov.au/PublicationsAndMedia/Publications/2016/Modelling-for-2016-17-budget" target="_self" title="" class="externalLink">Government&apos;s own modelling to support the company tax cut</a> revealed that were the rate to be cut to 25 per cent, then employment <em>in the long-run</em> would be improved by (drum roll) 0.1 per cent.</p><p>What a shock voters didn&apos;t take to the streets in celebration.</p><p>Malcolm Turnbull didn&apos;t really help himself either. He <a href="http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/doorstop-interview-with-assistant-minister-angus-taylor-and-russell-matheso" target="_self" title="" class="externalLink">told the media in May</a> that:</p><blockquote><p>One thing we know for sure is that when you cut business taxes, company taxes, the value of that, the benefit flows back into the economy and overwhelmingly goes back to workers, to labour.</p></blockquote><p>Now that is how things are expected to work, but it sounds very much like a trickledown economics view. Being told that giving a tax cut to someone else will eventually flow through to more income for you requires voters to have a lot of faith.</p><p>He also liked to cite the Treasury modelling that he argued showed that &quot;for every dollar cut in company tax $4 of value created in the overall economy.&quot;</p><p>Well yeah, but you don&apos;t eat GDP. And as the <a href="http://theconversation.com/the-full-story-on-company-tax-cuts-and-your-hip-pocket-59458" class="externalLink">Grattan Institute&apos;s John Daley</a> noted, that $4 was greatly reduced once you put it in National Income terms.</p><p>And if we&apos;re going to talk macroeconomic concepts like GDP and GNI, another good measure to note is the ABS&apos;s calculation of general economic wellbeing - net national disposable income.</p><p>During normal times it grows at much the same pace as GDP, but during the mining boom, it zoomed ahead of the actual economy.</p><p>Wonderful!

</div><p> </p><p>During the previous parliament, the Coalition was able to work around a similarly obstructionist Labor by doing deals with the newly pragmatic Greens. It is unclear at this point whether the Greens will again be prepared to be amenable to a returned Turnbull Government.</p><p>Accordingly, Turnbull will be forced to play to the whims of an even larger Senate crossbench than before the election. It will be weeks until the final numbers in the Senate are known, but <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/federal-election-2016/federal-election-2016-live-coverage/news-story/9379d446ef5987b19b99add5acd3f709" target="_self" title="" class="externalLink">early indications suggest</a> the Coalition has 30 senate seats, Labor 27 and the Greens nine, meaning a Coalition Government would need nine of the 10 crossbenchers to pass legislation.</p><p>Turnbull will likely be beholden not only to the protectionist demands of Nick Xenophon, but also to Fred Nile&apos;s Christian Democrats, the anti-paedophilia crusader Derryn Hinch, and the xenophobes Jacqui Lambie and Pauline Hanson.</p><p>Conversely, Labor combined with the Greens would need only three other votes to block government legislation - although, beyond the NXT senators, it is difficult to see three others whose votes Labor and the Greens would be willing to accept.</p><p>This spells the end of Turnbull&apos;s &quot;plan for jobs and growth&quot;, given Labor will support corporate tax cuts only for the smallest of businesses. Then again, Labor in Opposition may become born again fiscal conservatives, belatedly seeing the merit in preventing increased government spending (as long as it is Coalition government spending that is stopped), and causing even further grief for the PM.</p><p>Legislation to facilitate the plebiscite on same-sex marriage would also be doomed, with nine supporters of same-sex marriage (let alone the plebiscite) difficult to find within the predominantly conservative crossbench.</p><p>Of course Turnbull&apos;s conservative problem is much closer to home than the Senate crossbench. Nothing short of an increased Coalition majority would have satisfied the conservative rump within the Liberal Party and the commentariat that the Turnbull experiment justified the knifing of Abbott.</p><div class="inline-content wysiwyg full">

</div><p> </p><p>The former PM made a point of staying above the ground war waged by his supporters against Turnbull, leaving the heavy lifting to his former chief of staff, Peta Credlin, and other right-wing commentators on Sky News and in the Murdoch press.</p><p>These forces were gearing up to fight a modestly-returned Turnbull on superannuation and the same-sex marriage plebiscite. They would have had to respect Turnbull&apos;s mandate but still make him fight for his signature policies.</p><p>But as the results came in on election night, their disgruntlement turned to fury, setting off a round of recriminations that likely will not subside completely until Turnbull is replaced.</p><p>It is difficult to see a safe path for Turnbull to navigate through the minefield that he alone has created. Returning Abbott to Cabinet would simply provide the former PM with a stronger platform from which to build community and party room support. Julia Gillard made this mistake with Kevin Rudd, as did Abbott with Turnbull.</p><p>However, leaving Abbott on the backbench allows him to speak more freely than a Cabinet minister could, and gives him the time to duchesse the MPs who abandoned him for Turnbull and may now be experiencing buyers&apos; remorse.</p><p>Either way, the authority Turnbull needed to get contentious measures through the party room is seriously if not fatally diminished. Perhaps the only way he could get anything through both the party room and the Senate would be to pander to the conservatives in both. In effect, to become Abbott in a nicer suit.</p><p>Such a transition would put an end, once and for all, to the hope progressives and centrists once vested in Turnbull to be a truly liberal Prime Minister. But it might just be enough to win back the Liberal base.</p><p>It would mean selling his soul to the conservatives, but such a sacrifice might be the only way Turnbull can regain the mandate he threw away on election night.</p><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/paula-matthewson/44978" target="_self" title=""><em>Paula Matthewson</em></a><em> writes a weekly column for The Drum.

</div><p> </p><p>In our hearts we know better. We know enough to unpick the routine deceptions of political rhetoric.</p><p>We&apos;re not cowed by the demand for stability and steady economic management. We see it as the self-inflated rubric of a past time when a protected isolationist economic enclave could be managed by the local political and bureaucratic class. We&apos;ve watched decades of reform that have lauded the ungovernable chaos of markets as a guiding truth, neoliberal orthodoxies that have argued convincingly for the decline in government and sovereign influence.</p><p>We&apos;ve watched as major parties have shed their fiercest beliefs and drifted to the flexible accommodations of the political centre, all the while bristling with manufactured antagonisms and studied points of difference.</p><p>We&apos;ve watched as a true divide has grown, between the haves and have nots, the regions and the inner cities, the educated hopeful and the hapless.</p><p>And then came Mediscare and stop-the-boats worked, tapping into the wide anxieties of the underclass and the precariat.</p><p>Look at the primary vote numbers for proof of our drift from the comfortable certainties of two-party politics.</p><p>At time of publication, the Liberal Party was the first preference of 28.4 per cent of voters; the ALP of 35.3 per cent; the Nationals 4.9 per cent; the Liberal Nationals (Queensland) 8.3 per cent; and the Country Liberals 0.3 per cent, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2016/results/" target="_self" title="">according to the ABC</a>.</p><p>And here we see a simple truth: the great representative orthodoxy of Australian politics commands the accumulated and bitterly divided vote of 77.2* per cent of the people. It&apos;s a bifurcated majority, but for a quarter of the country, neither traditional political bloc is the first electoral choice.</p><p>Our parties need to find a core of belief if they are to recapture a core of public confidence. Perhaps new political groupings will do it in their place. Or perhaps we will get a taste for the purposeful negotiations of political coalitions and minority government.</p><p>Or we may stay static, with major parties increasingly representing fewer of us and with little in their acts or rhetoric to win us back.</p><p>There will be more Hansons in that world, more maddened chaos.</p><p>&quot;Mere anarchy ... loosed upon the world.&quot;</p><p><strong><em>* Editor&apos;s note: An earlier version of this article did not include the Liberal Nationals (Queensland) and the Country Liberals in this calculation.</em></strong></p><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/jonathan-green/27898" target="_self" title=""><em>Jonathan Green</em></a><em> is presenter of RN Sunday Extra and editor of the literary journal Meanjin.</em></p><div class="inline-content html-fragment full"><div class="ert-module-container" style="padding: 1px"></div>

No-one seems to care about us,&apos; and that&apos;s all they want, they want connection, they want to know that you really care about them and you are prepared.</p></blockquote><p>The simple truth about our politics is that it is ripe for disruption and change.</p><p>If Saturday&apos;s vote and its lingering aftermath show anything it&apos;s that the political duopoly that has held sway since 1945 is straining at the limits of its use-by date.</p><p>It got good at the craft that settled it in place, refining the practice of professional politicking to the point of hollow meaninglessness.</p><p>And this descent into political opportunism and trickery came in a time studded with change, uncertainty and a brace of wicked problems - climate, the future of work, terror: take your pick. The sort of glibness that can propose either a Medicare scare or a business tax cut as the policy core of some future certainty, is readily exposed as an empty but deeply cynical fraud.</p><div class="inline-content wysiwyg right">

</div><p> </p><p>In our hearts we know better. We know enough to unpick the routine deceptions of political rhetoric.</p><p>We&apos;re not cowed by the demand for stability and steady economic management. We see it as the self-inflated rubric of a past time when a protected isolationist economic enclave could be managed by the local political and bureaucratic class. We&apos;ve watched decades of reform that have lauded the ungovernable chaos of markets as a guiding truth, neoliberal orthodoxies that have argued convincingly for the decline in government and sovereign influence.</p><p>We&apos;ve watched as major parties have shed their fiercest beliefs and drifted to the flexible accommodations of the political centre, all the while bristling with manufactured antagonisms and studied points of difference.</p><p>We&apos;ve watched as a true divide has grown, between the haves and have nots, the regions and the inner cities, the educated hopeful and the hapless.</p><p>And then came Mediscare and stop-the-boats worked, tapping into the wide anxieties of the underclass and the precariat.</p><p>Look at the primary vote numbers for proof of our drift from the comfortable certainties of two-party politics.</p><p>At time of publication, the Liberal Party was the first preference of 28.4 per cent of voters; the ALP of 35.3 per cent; the Nationals 4.9 per cent; the Liberal Nationals (Queensland) 8.3 per cent; and the Country Liberals 0.3 per cent, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2016/results/" target="_self" title="">according to the ABC</a>.</p><p>And here we see a simple truth: the great representative orthodoxy of Australian politics commands the accumulated and bitterly divided vote of 77.2* per cent of the people. It&apos;s a bifurcated majority, but for a quarter of the country, neither traditional political bloc is the first electoral choice.</p><p>Our parties need to find a core of belief if they are to recapture a core of public confidence. Perhaps new political groupings will do it in their place. Or perhaps we will get a taste for the purposeful negotiations of political coalitions and minority government.</p><p>Or we may stay static, with major parties increasingly representing fewer of us and with little in their acts or rhetoric to win us back.</p><p>There will be more Hansons in that world, more maddened chaos.</p><p>&quot;Mere anarchy ... loosed upon the world.&quot;</p><p><strong><em>* Editor&apos;s note: An earlier version of this article did not include the Liberal Nationals (Queensland) and the Country Liberals in this calculation.</em></strong></p><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/jonathan-green/27898" target="_self" title=""><em>Jonathan Green</em></a><em> is presenter of RN Sunday Extra and editor of the literary journal Meanjin.</em></p><div class="inline-content html-fragment full"><div class="ert-module-container" style="padding: 1px"></div>

We can expect that it will continue to be the target of attacks by terrorists such as IS. And when plots and attacks occur, Australia and others should stay close to assist Turkey to maintain a course that will hold it in good stead for the long term, and not further divide the country.</p><p>Australia&apos;s contribution and that of others is vital to defeating jihadist groups and their ability to freely operate in and from the Middle East and North Africa. The road to success will be littered with the terrorist propaganda fed by threats of attack and attempts to inflict harm. But even these extreme symbols cannot hide the truth that, in less than two years, the so-called &quot;caliphate&quot; is essentially no more.</p><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/jacinta-carroll/6941604" target="_self" title=""><em>Jacinta Carroll</em></a><em> is senior analyst and director, Counter Terrorism Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.</em></p><p> </p>, tiny_mobile_url:, content_summary:[], first_create_date:2016-06-30 00:41:39, web_url:http://abc.net.au/news/7556448, attached_video:[], tiny_web_url:http://abc.net.au/news/7556448, extra:null, id:7556448, article_key:7556448.xml, byline:Jacinta Carroll, updated:2016-06-30 00:41:39, status:Usable]

</a></div><p> </p><h5>What hallucinogenic effects does Ayahuasca have on users?</h5><p>&quot;Ayahuasca can yield very different experiences but there&apos;s also some commonalities in terms of the themes that people associate with.</p><p>&quot;There can be very intense visual hallucinations as part of the experience, they can be very beautiful, geometric, moving. </p><p>&quot;They can be organic and linked to plants or perhaps animals, shapes or spirits that people perceive, light.</p><p>&quot;I think there&apos;s often a sense that what people see can be profoundly beautiful, rapturously beautiful and at the same time that people perceive the beauty they also feel that there&apos;s a sense of meaning or a deeper truth that&apos;s inside these beautiful images.</p><p>&quot;And of course there can be very terrifying things that people witness.</p><p>&quot;They can experience perhaps memories that have been repressed or fear, deep-seeded fears that they have could manifest in visions so it can be a space of terror and beauty.</p><p>&quot;There&apos;s a sort of catharsis that comes from that juxtaposition of the horror and the beauty.&quot; </p><h5>Can Ayahuasca induce homicidal thoughts?</h5><div class="inline-content photo right"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/ayahuasca-being-grated/7452804"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7452756-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A man grates Ayahuasca for use." title="Ayahuasca being grated" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t know of any literature that specifically makes a direct link between homicidal thoughts and Ayahuasca, but there&apos;s no doubt that Ayahuasca can induce visions of violence or terrifying violent situations.</p><p>&quot;Also it could bring to the fore powerful emotions that people have related to particular individuals. </p><p>&quot;Those powerful emotions combined with this sort of visionary experiences could be interpreted as thinking about killing someone but that&apos;s in a visionary space, that&apos;s in a very altered state of consciousness. </p><p>&quot;So the question of homicidal thoughts then really depends on how those feelings in the visionary terrain are interpreted by the Ayahuasca drinker, whether they see those as metaphors relating to their life or a sort of intensified feelings towards that person that the vision has brought on or do they mobilise in a very rational sense on those feelings.&quot;</p><h5>How prevalent is the drug in Australia?</h5><p>&quot;It&apos;s hard to say exactly how many people are using Ayahuasca in Australia but at least 1,000 in something like a regular situation.</p><p>&quot;There are people around Australia who organise ceremonies in which up to 50 people might attend and drink Ayahuasca over the course of a night.</p><p>&quot;These ceremonies are interpreted or run differently by different facilitators, some of whom have been working for decades in Australia and who draw influences from the churches as well as neoshamanic practices in indigenous traditions in South America.</p><p>&quot;But I would say that many more than 1,000 people have tried Ayahuasca.&quot;</p><h5>How unpredictable is Ayahuasca?</h5><p>&quot;Ayahuasca does seem to be quite remarkable in the degree of its effects, even controlling for things like setting, the physical setting where people consume the drug, people preparing for it mentally in the same way, preparing the dose in the same way.</p><p>&quot;People who have drunk Ayahuasca regularly for some time might not know what to expect each time ... You&apos;re dealing with crude plant-based chemicals, so it&apos;s not like you&apos;re controlling in a very exact way the dosages, but it really would appear that it&apos;s beyond the specific dosage &#x2014; there is so much psychological variability in the experience.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/ayahuasca-in-a-bowl/7452776"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7452700-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Intoxicating ants with Ayahuasca." title="Ayahuasca in a bowl" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><h5>Is it considered to be a spiritual tool rather than a recreational drug?</h5><p>&quot;In my experience in Australia and throughout the world principally, absolutely yes.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s not something entered into lightly by people and these sorts of ritual ceremonies, and these are new traditions in Australia that Australian facilitators have developed themselves, [and] are based on the principle of these plant substances being sacred and that people should approach it with caution and care.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s not a drug that lends itself to parties, you&apos;re sort of laid out physically at one level and often times not able to talk although you might be able to articulate sounds you might not be able to carry on a conversation so it really doesn&apos;t lend itself to social settings or parties.&quot;</p><h5>What are the potential benefits and healing powers of Ayahuasca?</h5><p>&quot;There&apos;s an explosion right now of medical research into Ayahuasca.</p><div class="inline-content photo right"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/dr-robin-rodd/7448348"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7308630-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Professor Robin Rodd conducting field research in Venezuela." title="Dr Robin Rodd" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>&quot;Much of that research is looking at the potential for Ayahuasca to play a positive role in healing or preventing diseases of civilisation, things like degenerative disorders, depression, addiction, even its potential for treatment of Alzheimer&apos;s.</p><p>&quot;Long-term Ayahuasca drinking builds density of serotonin receptor sites which is correlated possibly with the sense of improved mood as well as possibly some social optimism, relationships and could be a buffer against things like depression. That&apos;s based on research among long-term users in a church context.</p><p>&quot;I think recent work pointing to its role as a generalised buffer against stress ... There appears to be interesting leads that Ayahuasca can open for that as well as of course addiction research for which we have a very solid empirical basis to say that Ayahuasca consumed in a therapeutic community can have really beneficial effects on halting addictive tendencies in people.&quot;</p>, tiny_mobile_url=, content_summary=[inline-photo], first_create_date=2016-09-28 05:56:34, web_url=http://abc.net.au/news/7442714, attached_video=[], tiny_web_url=http://abc.net.au/news/7442714, extra=null, id=7442714, article_key=7442714.xml, byline=, updated=2016-09-28 05:56:34, status=Usable}

</a></div><p> </p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t know of any literature that specifically makes a direct link between homicidal thoughts and Ayahuasca, but there&apos;s no doubt that Ayahuasca can induce visions of violence or terrifying violent situations.</p><p>&quot;Also it could bring to the fore powerful emotions that people have related to particular individuals. </p><p>&quot;Those powerful emotions combined with this sort of visionary experiences could be interpreted as thinking about killing someone but that&apos;s in a visionary space, that&apos;s in a very altered state of consciousness. </p><p>&quot;So the question of homicidal thoughts then really depends on how those feelings in the visionary terrain are interpreted by the Ayahuasca drinker, whether they see those as metaphors relating to their life or a sort of intensified feelings towards that person that the vision has brought on or do they mobilise in a very rational sense on those feelings.&quot;</p><h5>How prevalent is the drug in Australia?</h5><p>&quot;It&apos;s hard to say exactly how many people are using Ayahuasca in Australia but at least 1,000 in something like a regular situation.</p><p>&quot;There are people around Australia who organise ceremonies in which up to 50 people might attend and drink Ayahuasca over the course of a night.</p><p>&quot;These ceremonies are interpreted or run differently by different facilitators, some of whom have been working for decades in Australia and who draw influences from the churches as well as neoshamanic practices in indigenous traditions in South America.</p><p>&quot;But I would say that many more than 1,000 people have tried Ayahuasca.&quot;</p><h5>How unpredictable is Ayahuasca?</h5><p>&quot;Ayahuasca does seem to be quite remarkable in the degree of its effects, even controlling for things like setting, the physical setting where people consume the drug, people preparing for it mentally in the same way, preparing the dose in the same way.</p><p>&quot;People who have drunk Ayahuasca regularly for some time might not know what to expect each time ... You&apos;re dealing with crude plant-based chemicals, so it&apos;s not like you&apos;re controlling in a very exact way the dosages, but it really would appear that it&apos;s beyond the specific dosage &#x2014; there is so much psychological variability in the experience.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/ayahuasca-in-a-bowl/7452776"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7452700-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Intoxicating ants with Ayahuasca." title="Ayahuasca in a bowl" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><h5>Is it considered to be a spiritual tool rather than a recreational drug?</h5><p>&quot;In my experience in Australia and throughout the world principally, absolutely yes.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s not something entered into lightly by people and these sorts of ritual ceremonies, and these are new traditions in Australia that Australian facilitators have developed themselves, [and] are based on the principle of these plant substances being sacred and that people should approach it with caution and care.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s not a drug that lends itself to parties, you&apos;re sort of laid out physically at one level and often times not able to talk although you might be able to articulate sounds you might not be able to carry on a conversation so it really doesn&apos;t lend itself to social settings or parties.&quot;</p><h5>What are the potential benefits and healing powers of Ayahuasca?</h5><p>&quot;There&apos;s an explosion right now of medical research into Ayahuasca.</p><div class="inline-content photo right"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/dr-robin-rodd/7448348"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7308630-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Professor Robin Rodd conducting field research in Venezuela." title="Dr Robin Rodd" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>&quot;Much of that research is looking at the potential for Ayahuasca to play a positive role in healing or preventing diseases of civilisation, things like degenerative disorders, depression, addiction, even its potential for treatment of Alzheimer&apos;s.</p><p>&quot;Long-term Ayahuasca drinking builds density of serotonin receptor sites which is correlated possibly with the sense of improved mood as well as possibly some social optimism, relationships and could be a buffer against things like depression. That&apos;s based on research among long-term users in a church context.</p><p>&quot;I think recent work pointing to its role as a generalised buffer against stress ... There appears to be interesting leads that Ayahuasca can open for that as well as of course addiction research for which we have a very solid empirical basis to say that Ayahuasca consumed in a therapeutic community can have really beneficial effects on halting addictive tendencies in people.&quot;</p>, tiny_mobile_url:, content_summary:[inline-photo], first_create_date:2016-09-28 05:56:34, web_url:http://abc.net.au/news/7442714, attached_video:[], tiny_web_url:http://abc.net.au/news/7442714, extra:null, id:7442714, article_key:7442714.xml, byline:, updated:2016-09-28 05:56:34, status:Usable]

Then at touchdown we&apos;re doing 0.9 metres per second, which is about three kilometres an hour,&quot; Mr Holmes said.</p><p>He said the ESA team will know that Rosetta has collided with the comet because the signal it&apos;s transmitting home will suddenly disappear as the high-gain antenna onboard the craft is jolted away from Earth.</p><p>&quot;When we crash, that high gain antenna will jolt massively, and it will just lose the Earth&apos;s transmission,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;There&apos;s no electronics that could then re-acquire the signal.&quot;</p><h4>On a collision course with the Ma&apos;at region</h4><p>The scientists have calculated Rosetta will land on the Ma&apos;at region on the head of the duck-shaped comet.</p><p>As it descends to the planned landing point, Rosetta will take measurements of the dust, plasma, and gas in the environment close to the surface, as well as high-resolution photographs of mysterious pit holes in the comet.</p><p>The Ma&apos;at region is of particular interest to scientists because those pit holes haven&apos;t been seen anywhere else in our solar system.</p><p>Some pits in the area run up to 60 metres deep and might allow scientists to peer inside of the comet, giving clues as to how comets form.</p><p>&quot;They don&apos;t exist on any other planetary body in our system, we&apos;ve never seen them before,&quot; Mr Holmes said.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re going to be seeing millimetre-level resolution from these very powerful Osiris cameras that we have on Rosetta.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/the-ma&#x27;at-region/7877364"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7877364-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="An image showing the Ma&#x27;at region of comet 67P" title="The Ma&#x27;at region" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>Exactly what is revealed will depend on the images captured by Rosetta in its last moments.</p><p>Scientists still aren&apos;t sure exactly how the gravity of the comet close-by to the surface will affect the spacecraft, and they&apos;re also concerned about how dust and gas spewing from the comet might affect its trajectory.</p><p>But the ESA is predicting the craft will land relatively close to the point on the comet it&apos;s aiming at despite these uncertainties.</p><h4>Rosetta an &apos;ark of humanity&apos;</h4><p>Despite the low gravity of the comet, Rosetta should remain on its surface for billions of years if nothing disturbs it.</p><p>Mr Holmes said the craft is a veritable &quot;ark of humanity,&quot; because its insides contained the human DNA of all those who had worked on assembling it.</p><p>&quot;Humans, myself included, spent dozens of hours deep inside the spacecraft doing all the electrical connections and the electrical testing ... I know many times I was sneezing or coughing,&quot; he said.</p><p>He hoped Rosetta might one day be recovered and opened up to find the preserved DNA of the people who worked on the craft.</p><p>&quot;The decision&apos;s now been made to put Rosetta down onto the surface, and as a consequence it&apos;s become a Noah&apos;s ark of human DNA, for aliens or future humans to go up and clone us all over again.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content wysiwyg full">

Then at touchdown we&apos;re doing 0.9 metres per second, which is about three kilometres an hour,&quot; Mr Holmes said.</p><p>He said the ESA team will know that Rosetta has collided with the comet because the signal it&apos;s transmitting home will suddenly disappear as the high-gain antenna onboard the craft is jolted away from Earth.</p><p>&quot;When we crash, that high gain antenna will jolt massively, and it will just lose the Earth&apos;s transmission,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;There&apos;s no electronics that could then re-acquire the signal.&quot;</p><h4>On a collision course with the Ma&apos;at region</h4><p>The scientists have calculated Rosetta will land on the Ma&apos;at region on the head of the duck-shaped comet.</p><p>As it descends to the planned landing point, Rosetta will take measurements of the dust, plasma, and gas in the environment close to the surface, as well as high-resolution photographs of mysterious pit holes in the comet.</p><p>The Ma&apos;at region is of particular interest to scientists because those pit holes haven&apos;t been seen anywhere else in our solar system.</p><p>Some pits in the area run up to 60 metres deep and might allow scientists to peer inside of the comet, giving clues as to how comets form.</p><p>&quot;They don&apos;t exist on any other planetary body in our system, we&apos;ve never seen them before,&quot; Mr Holmes said.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re going to be seeing millimetre-level resolution from these very powerful Osiris cameras that we have on Rosetta.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/the-ma&#x27;at-region/7877364"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7877364-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="An image showing the Ma&#x27;at region of comet 67P" title="The Ma&#x27;at region" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>Exactly what is revealed will depend on the images captured by Rosetta in its last moments.</p><p>Scientists still aren&apos;t sure exactly how the gravity of the comet close-by to the surface will affect the spacecraft, and they&apos;re also concerned about how dust and gas spewing from the comet might affect its trajectory.</p><p>But the ESA is predicting the craft will land relatively close to the point on the comet it&apos;s aiming at despite these uncertainties.</p><h4>Rosetta an &apos;ark of humanity&apos;</h4><p>Despite the low gravity of the comet, Rosetta should remain on its surface for billions of years if nothing disturbs it.</p><p>Mr Holmes said the craft is a veritable &quot;ark of humanity,&quot; because its insides contained the human DNA of all those who had worked on assembling it.</p><p>&quot;Humans, myself included, spent dozens of hours deep inside the spacecraft doing all the electrical connections and the electrical testing ... I know many times I was sneezing or coughing,&quot; he said.</p><p>He hoped Rosetta might one day be recovered and opened up to find the preserved DNA of the people who worked on the craft.</p><p>&quot;The decision&apos;s now been made to put Rosetta down onto the surface, and as a consequence it&apos;s become a Noah&apos;s ark of human DNA, for aliens or future humans to go up and clone us all over again.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content wysiwyg full">

These are known as &quot;amplifying feedbacks&quot;. <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2008/TargetCO2_20080407.pdf" class="externalLink">Some are fast</a>, such as changes in water vapour, clouds, aerosols and sea ice.</p><p><a href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1856/1925." class="externalLink">Others are slower</a>.

These are known as &quot;amplifying feedbacks&quot;. <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2008/TargetCO2_20080407.pdf" class="externalLink">Some are fast</a>, such as changes in water vapour, clouds, aerosols and sea ice.</p><p><a href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1856/1925." class="externalLink">Others are slower</a>.

</div><p> </p><p>In the latest Star Wars episode, The Force Awakens, villain Kylo Ren uses The Force to stop a laser blast mid-air as it heads towards him.</p><p>Now researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) have done something similar by using a cloud of very cold atoms to stop light moving.</p><p>The development, published today in <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nphys3901" target="_self" title="" class="externalLink">Nature Physics</a>, could be used to make a quantum logic gate, which is an important building block in the development of quantum computers, said lead author Jesse Everett, a doctoral student at ANU&apos;s Centre for Quantum Computation and Communications Technology.</p><p>&quot;The idea [for quantum computing] is we are trying to get two individual particles of light &#x2014; photons &#x2014; to interact,&quot; Mr Everett said.</p><p>&quot;The interaction between them [normally] is very weak so if we can get them in the same place for a long time we can increase that interaction so it is measurable.&quot;</p><p>While the advance was important for quantum science, Mr Everett said it was also interesting to be able to bring a piece of science fiction to life.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;It&apos;s pretty amazing to look at a sci-fi movie and say we actually did something that&apos;s a bit like that,&quot; Mr Everett said.</p></blockquote><div class="inline-content full"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2JwB9Zg_IE" class="externalLink"><span><strong>External Link:</strong> Kylo Ren uses &quot;The Force&quot; to stop a blast of light</span> </a></div><p> </p><h4>How to stop light with science</h4><p>Associate Professor Ben Buchler, senior author on the paper, said light normally travels around 300,000 kilometres per second.</p><p>However he said it was still possible to go faster than the speed of light &quot;not by going faster yourself, but by making light slower&quot;.</p><p>Dr Buchler said in their latest study the team had used rubidium atoms which interact very strongly with light at a wavelength at the edge of what was visible to the human eye.</p><p>In the experiment these atoms were modified so that when they were hit with lasers they constantly emitted and then re-captured the light.</p><p>&quot;The result is you have a cloud of stationary light,&quot; Dr Buchler said.</p><p>He said while it was not the first time physicists had stopped light, the system they had developed meant they could show the light was stationary.</p><p>&quot;With this experiment we have the best proof that the light is actually stationary because we have taken photos of the atoms from the side that show they are in the right pattern to support the stationary light,&quot; he said.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;Previously, experiments have just inferred the existence of stationary light in an indirect way and although you could believe them it was nowhere near as convincing as this experiment.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Dr Buchler said another key development was that the system was incredibly stable and self-correcting.</p><p>&quot;If you get that preparation slightly wrong, it doesn&apos;t matter so much. Some of the light will leave the atoms, but the remaining light self-stabilises to form a new stationary state of light,&quot; he said. </p><p>&quot;No-one has ever seen that before.&quot; </p><h4>What this means for quantum computing</h4><p>Dr Buchler said quantum computing would rely on developing systems that were sensitive to a single photon.</p><p>&quot;It is very difficult for photons to talk to each other,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;If you can stop a single photon of light, make it stationary and hold it for a long time you might be able to get that single photon to talk very strongly to another field of light or another single photon ... that is the building block for a quantum gate which is essential to a quantum computer.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content video full"> <a href="http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/news/video/201609/CNb_StoppingLight_2609_256k.mp4?type=video_onDemand&#x26;title=Video: How light and atoms work together to build a quantum gate.

</div><p> </p><p>In the latest Star Wars episode, The Force Awakens, villain Kylo Ren uses The Force to stop a laser blast mid-air as it heads towards him.</p><p>Now researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) have done something similar by using a cloud of very cold atoms to stop light moving.</p><p>The development, published today in <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nphys3901" target="_self" title="" class="externalLink">Nature Physics</a>, could be used to make a quantum logic gate, which is an important building block in the development of quantum computers, said lead author Jesse Everett, a doctoral student at ANU&apos;s Centre for Quantum Computation and Communications Technology.</p><p>&quot;The idea [for quantum computing] is we are trying to get two individual particles of light &#x2014; photons &#x2014; to interact,&quot; Mr Everett said.</p><p>&quot;The interaction between them [normally] is very weak so if we can get them in the same place for a long time we can increase that interaction so it is measurable.&quot;</p><p>While the advance was important for quantum science, Mr Everett said it was also interesting to be able to bring a piece of science fiction to life.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;It&apos;s pretty amazing to look at a sci-fi movie and say we actually did something that&apos;s a bit like that,&quot; Mr Everett said.</p></blockquote><div class="inline-content full"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2JwB9Zg_IE" class="externalLink"><span><strong>External Link:</strong> Kylo Ren uses &quot;The Force&quot; to stop a blast of light</span> </a></div><p> </p><h4>How to stop light with science</h4><p>Associate Professor Ben Buchler, senior author on the paper, said light normally travels around 300,000 kilometres per second.</p><p>However he said it was still possible to go faster than the speed of light &quot;not by going faster yourself, but by making light slower&quot;.</p><p>Dr Buchler said in their latest study the team had used rubidium atoms which interact very strongly with light at a wavelength at the edge of what was visible to the human eye.</p><p>In the experiment these atoms were modified so that when they were hit with lasers they constantly emitted and then re-captured the light.</p><p>&quot;The result is you have a cloud of stationary light,&quot; Dr Buchler said.</p><p>He said while it was not the first time physicists had stopped light, the system they had developed meant they could show the light was stationary.</p><p>&quot;With this experiment we have the best proof that the light is actually stationary because we have taken photos of the atoms from the side that show they are in the right pattern to support the stationary light,&quot; he said.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;Previously, experiments have just inferred the existence of stationary light in an indirect way and although you could believe them it was nowhere near as convincing as this experiment.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Dr Buchler said another key development was that the system was incredibly stable and self-correcting.</p><p>&quot;If you get that preparation slightly wrong, it doesn&apos;t matter so much. Some of the light will leave the atoms, but the remaining light self-stabilises to form a new stationary state of light,&quot; he said. </p><p>&quot;No-one has ever seen that before.&quot; </p><h4>What this means for quantum computing</h4><p>Dr Buchler said quantum computing would rely on developing systems that were sensitive to a single photon.</p><p>&quot;It is very difficult for photons to talk to each other,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;If you can stop a single photon of light, make it stationary and hold it for a long time you might be able to get that single photon to talk very strongly to another field of light or another single photon ... that is the building block for a quantum gate which is essential to a quantum computer.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content video full"> <a href="http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/news/video/201609/CNb_StoppingLight_2609_256k.mp4?type=video_onDemand&#x26;title=Video: How light and atoms work together to build a quantum gate.

</div><p> </p><p>The aural artefact, which paved the way for everything from synthesisers to modern electronica, opens with a staunchly conservative tune &#x2014; the British national anthem God Save the King.</p><p>Researchers at the University of Canterbury (UC) in Christchurch said it showed Turing &#x2014; best known as the father of computing who broke the WWII Enigma code &#x2014; was also a musical innovator.</p><p>&quot;Alan Turing&apos;s pioneering work in the late 1940s on transforming the computer into a musical instrument has been largely overlooked,&quot; they said.</p><p>The recording was made 65 years ago by a BBC outside-broadcast unit at the Computing Machine Laboratory in Manchester, northern England.</p><p>The machine, which filled much of the lab&apos;s ground floor, was used to generate three melodies; God Save the King, Baa Baa Black Sheep and Glenn Miller&apos;s swing classic In the Mood.</p><p>But when UC professor Jack Copeland and composer Jason Long examined the 12-inch acetate disc containing the music, they found the audio was distorted.</p><h4>Slightly grating drone, like electronic bagpipes</h4><p>&quot;The frequencies in the recording were not accurate. The recording gave at best only a rough impression of how the computer sounded,&quot; they said.</p><p>They fixed it with electronic detective work, tweaking the speed of the audio, compensating for a &quot;wobble&quot; in the recording and filtering out extraneous noise.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;It was a beautiful moment when we first heard the true sound of Turing&apos;s computer,&quot; Copeland and Long said in a blog post on the British Library website.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href="http://blogs.bl.uk/files/first-recorded-computer-music---copeland-long-restoration.mp3" target="_self" title="" class="externalLink">two-minute recording</a> features short snippets of the tunes rendered in a slightly grating drone, like electronic bagpipes.</p><p>There are also a number of glitches and when the music halts during the Glenn Miller number, a presenter comments: &quot;The machine&apos;s obviously not in the mood.</p><p>While Turing programmed the first musical notes into a computer, he had little interest in stringing them together into tunes.</p><p>That work was carried out by a school teacher named Christopher Strachey, who went on to become a renowned computer scientist in his own right.</p><p>Strachey recalled that Turing&apos;s taciturn response upon hearing his machine play music was &quot;good show&quot;.</p><p>Turing was a computer scientist, philosopher and cryptologist who played a crucial role in breaking the Nazis&apos; Enigma Code.</p><p>As depicted in the Oscar-winning movie The Imitation Game, he was prosecuted for homosexuality and forced to undergo chemical castration, killing himself in 1954 at the age of 41.</p><p>He was officially pardoned by Queen Elizabeth II in 2013.</p><p><strong>AFP</strong></p>, tiny_mobile_url:, content_summary:[], first_create_date:2016-09-26 05:13:42, web_url:http://abc.net.au/news/7878014, attached_video:[], tiny_web_url:http://ab.co/2cvso7n, extra:null, id:7878014, article_key:7878014.xml, byline:, updated:2016-09-26 05:13:42, status:Usable]

we wondered if that would affect them,&quot; she said.</p><p>Other results which raised concern was the habitat assessments with four sites showing moderate degradations and high levels of phosphate found at three sites.</p><p>Many of the students involved in the science experiment had grown up in the area and were alarmed at what they saw. </p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;Being on the river was sad because although we spend a lot of time on the river we were alarmed to learn what was going on with the health of the river,&quot; student Coco Dara said.</p></blockquote><p>The students plan to continue their work by conducting targeted follow up testing of the river with OzGREEN. </p><p>They also plan to create a social enterprise to sell special eco-friendly reusable take-away coffee cups.</p><p>&quot;We wanted to do something that helps shift people towards being more conscious about the impact of their everyday actions,&quot; Ms Dara said.</p><p>&quot;That&apos;s how we came up with the idea of Turtles are Keepers reusable cups.</p><p>&quot;We can both raise funds to support further research, education and action as well as raise awareness.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-18/a-rare-snapping-turtle-is-checked-by-npws-workers/6330306"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/6330306-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A rare snapping turtle is checked by NPWS workers" title="A rare snapping turtle is checked by NPWS workers" width="340" height="227">

</div><p> </p><p>The baby boy was born five months ago in Mexico to Jordanian parents, and is healthy and doing well, said the report in New Scientist magazine.</p><p>The boy&apos;s mother carried genes for a disorder known as Leigh Syndrome, a fatal nervous system disorder which she had passed on to her two previous children who both died of the disease.</p><p>She had also suffered four miscarriages.</p><p>The woman, whose identity was withheld by New Scientist, and her husband sought the help of John Zhang, a doctor from the New Hope Fertility Centre in New York City to have a baby that would be genetically related to them but would not carry the inherited disease.</p><p>The United States has not approved any three-parent method for fertility purposes, so Dr Zhang went to Mexico where he was quoted by New Scientist as saying &quot;there are no rules&quot;.</p><p>One method that has been approved in the United Kingdom, called pronuclear transfer, was deemed unacceptable to the couple because it would involve the destruction of two embryos, said the report.</p><p>Since the mother carried the genes for the disease in her mitochondria, or DNA that is passed down from the maternal side, Dr Zhang used her nuclear DNA and combined it with mitochondria from an egg donor, in a technique known as spindle nuclear transfer.</p><p>&quot;He removed the nucleus from one of the mother&apos;s eggs and inserted it into a donor egg that had had its own nucleus removed,&quot; the report said.</p><p>&quot;The resulting egg &#x2014; with nuclear DNA from the mother and mitochondrial DNA from a donor &#x2014; was then fertilized with the father&apos;s sperm.&quot;</p><h4>Medical team criticised for manner of announcement</h4><p>Dr Zhang and his team are expected to describe their method at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah, next month.</p><p>An abstract describing the research has been published in the journal Fertility and Sterility, but outside experts said much more remains to be understood about the research.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;As this technology is controversial and a world first, I think the investigators should have submitted a manuscript for full peer review instead of announcing these outcomes in this manner,&quot; said Justin St John, professor and Director of the Centre for Genetic Diseases at Monash University.</p></blockquote><p>Attempts began in the 1990s to create a baby by injecting mitochondrial DNA from a donor into the mother&apos;s egg, and adding sperm from her partner.</p><p>&quot;Some of the babies went on to develop genetic disorders, and the technique was banned,&quot; the New Scientist report said.</p><p><strong>AFP</strong></p>, tiny_mobile_url:, content_summary:[], first_create_date:2016-09-27 19:06:45, web_url:http://abc.net.au/news/7883386, attached_video:[], tiny_web_url:http://abc.net.au/news/7883386, extra:null, id:7883386, article_key:7883386.xml, byline:, updated:2016-09-28 02:03:33, status:Usable]

And the article also prompted many <a href="https://www.facebook.com/abcnews.au/posts/10155479297449988" target="_self" title="" class="externalLink">comments on Facebook</a>, from people who wanted to share their own experiences:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>&quot;Chewing with the mouth open, scraping knives and forks, and the hushed tones people use to lead people in meditation are triggers of major fits of rage for me.

She can never be sure she won&apos;t hear something that will stop her in her tracks.</p><p>&quot;I feel my breath quickening, I&apos;ll be clutching my hands, it&apos;s all I can focus on ... that noise is spinning around in my head and it&apos;s like nothing else is existing in that moment,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;ve gotten off buses early because there&apos;s been someone on that bus triggering me. I&apos;ve left university lectures. The cinema&apos;s a really tough place to be &#x2014; I really only go if I absolutely love the movie ... plastic rustling is a big one. So people opening a chip packet or lollies.&quot;</p><p> </p><p>So how does she manage from day to day?</p><p>&quot;Avoidance would be the biggest [way]. But it&apos;s so bad, because I don&apos;t want to miss out on things,&quot; she said. </p><p>&quot;It hurts your relationships. I avoid having meals with my family because of it.

I always have some quick excuse to get something from another room ... so as not appear rude.&#x201D;</p><p>Melissa says seeing psychologists has provided few answers or solutions. But she carries noise cancelling headphones wherever she goes. And she&apos;s also careful who she tells about her misophonia, as many people don&apos;t believe the condition is real and some simply write her off as &quot;difficult&quot;.</p><p>For this reason, she says it really helps that her partner is understanding.</p><p>&quot;He&apos;s got a really open mind &#x2026; living together he can see the daily struggle. I think it would be easier to write it off if you just heard about it,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;We get told &apos;it&apos;s just a noise&apos; or &apos;everyone hates some noises&apos;. But when you can see your loved one having to deal with it and struggling with it day in, day out ... he&apos;s fantastic in supporting me and trying to avoid triggering me.&quot;</p><h4>Hopes for new treatments, more understanding</h4><p>Despite the difficulties she faces every day, Melissa still manages to keep a sense of humour.</p><p>&quot;I usually sleep with earplugs as well, because otherwise I can&#x2019;t sleep, focusing on other noises or my partners breathing ... and he has to breath,&quot; she laughed.</p><p>She&apos;s also found solace online, chatting to other people with misophonia on a Facebook support group.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;Everyday there&apos;s a new person. And usually their first post is, &apos;I&apos;m so glad there are other people out there like me and that there&apos;s a word for this condition&apos;,&quot; she said.</p></blockquote><p>Most of the older people on the message board say for them, the problem has gotten worse with age &#x2014; and Melissa says this has also been her experience. But she&apos;s encouraged by current research on the condition and hopes it will yield new therapies and more understanding from the broader public.</p><p>&quot;We would really love to have some kind of treatment as time goes on, and some kind of understand around it, to help us better tolerate it and live with it each day,&quot; she said.</p><p> </p>, tiny_mobile_url=, content_summary=[], first_create_date=2016-09-25 23:49:13, web_url=http://abc.net.au/news/7873002, attached_video=[], tiny_web_url=http://ab.co/2cv3MM6, extra=null, id=7873002, article_key=7873002.xml, byline=Lynne Malcolm and Tegan Osborne, updated=2016-09-25 23:53:14, status=Usable}

She can never be sure she won&apos;t hear something that will stop her in her tracks.</p><p>&quot;I feel my breath quickening, I&apos;ll be clutching my hands, it&apos;s all I can focus on ... that noise is spinning around in my head and it&apos;s like nothing else is existing in that moment,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;ve gotten off buses early because there&apos;s been someone on that bus triggering me. I&apos;ve left university lectures. The cinema&apos;s a really tough place to be &#x2014; I really only go if I absolutely love the movie ... plastic rustling is a big one. So people opening a chip packet or lollies.&quot;</p><p> </p><p>So how does she manage from day to day?</p><p>&quot;Avoidance would be the biggest [way]. But it&apos;s so bad, because I don&apos;t want to miss out on things,&quot; she said. </p><p>&quot;It hurts your relationships. I avoid having meals with my family because of it. Usually your loved ones are you biggest triggers and that&#x2019;s definitely true in my case ... I always know where a door is. I always have some quick excuse to get something from another room ... so as not appear rude.&#x201D;</p><p>Melissa says seeing psychologists has provided few answers or solutions. But she carries noise cancelling headphones wherever she goes. And she&apos;s also careful who she tells about her misophonia, as many people don&apos;t believe the condition is real and some simply write her off as &quot;difficult&quot;.</p><p>For this reason, she says it really helps that her partner is understanding.</p><p>&quot;He&apos;s got a really open mind &#x2026; living together he can see the daily struggle. I think it would be easier to write it off if you just heard about it,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;We get told &apos;it&apos;s just a noise&apos; or &apos;everyone hates some noises&apos;. But when you can see your loved one having to deal with it and struggling with it day in, day out ... he&apos;s fantastic in supporting me and trying to avoid triggering me.&quot;</p><h4>Hopes for new treatments, more understanding</h4><p>Despite the difficulties she faces every day, Melissa still manages to keep a sense of humour.</p><p>&quot;I usually sleep with earplugs as well, because otherwise I can&#x2019;t sleep, focusing on other noises or my partners breathing ... and he has to breath,&quot; she laughed.</p><p>She&apos;s also found solace online, chatting to other people with misophonia on a Facebook support group.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;Everyday there&apos;s a new person. And usually their first post is, &apos;I&apos;m so glad there are other people out there like me and that there&apos;s a word for this condition&apos;,&quot; she said.</p></blockquote><p>Most of the older people on the message board say for them, the problem has gotten worse with age &#x2014; and Melissa says this has also been her experience. But she&apos;s encouraged by current research on the condition and hopes it will yield new therapies and more understanding from the broader public.</p><p>&quot;We would really love to have some kind of treatment as time goes on, and some kind of understand around it, to help us better tolerate it and live with it each day,&quot; she said.</p><p> </p>, tiny_mobile_url:, content_summary:[], first_create_date:2016-09-25 23:49:13, web_url:http://abc.net.au/news/7873002, attached_video:[], tiny_web_url:http://ab.co/2cv3MM6, extra:null, id:7873002, article_key:7873002.xml, byline:Lynne Malcolm and Tegan Osborne, updated:2016-09-25 23:53:14, status:Usable]

It&apos;s a network of regions that work together to process and make sense of the world.</p><p>Neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, are used as chemical messengers to send signals across the network. Brain regions receive these signals, which results in us recognising objects and situations, assigning them an emotional value to guide behaviour and making split-second risk/reward assessments.</p><p>The limbic system sits under the cerebrum (the largest and newest part of the brain) and is made up of structures such as the hypothalamus, hippocampus and the amygdala.</p><p>The almond-shaped <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627305008238" class="externalLink">amygdala</a> attaches emotional significance to events and memories.

Two particular networks that stand out across numerous studies are the autobiographic memory network and cognitive control network.</p><p>The autobiographic memory network processes information related to ourselves, including recalling personal memories and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502540" class="externalLink">self-reflection</a>. </p><p>Key <a href="http://psych.colorado.edu/~hannaje/Publications_&#x26;_CV_files/Andrews-Hanna_Smallwood_Spreng_YCN_2014.pdf" class="externalLink">hubs in this network</a> comprise brain areas inside the prefrontal cortex, which sits in the front of the brain; the hippocampus; the posterior cingulate cortex, which is the upper part of the limbic lobe; and parietal regions, which sit behind the frontal lobe and are important for mental imagery.</p><p>The cognitive control network links up regions that coordinate our attention and concentration so that we can <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661313002222" class="externalLink">complete tasks</a>. It recruits a circuit of <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-011-0083-5" class="externalLink">the front part of the cingulate cortex</a> and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which are specialised for cold, unemotional, rational thought.</p><p>These two networks are thought to have a strained relationship. The autobiographic memory network switches on when someone is preoccupied by thoughts concerning themselves. </p><p>This causes <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2850105/" class="externalLink">the task-oriented cognitive control network to switch off</a>, thereby reducing our ability to complete whatever task we&apos;re supposed to be doing. This is why daydreaming is frowned on at work.</p><p>Conversely, the autobiographic memory network is suppressed when the cognitive control network <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19913622" class="externalLink">is required to gather the attention needed for a task at hand</a>. This is in line with the notion that we &quot;lose ourselves&quot; when we are absorbed doing something.</p><p>When the two networks don&apos;t work properly, they can result in what psychiatrists refer to as <a href="https://theconversation.com/feeling-down-when-does-a-mood-become-a-disorder-14566" class="externalLink">mood disorders</a>.</p><div class="inline-content infographic full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-26/two-types-of-memory/7872930"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/7872930/data/two-types-of-memory-data.png" alt="" title="Two types of memory" width="700" height="498">

Brain regions receive these signals, which results in us recognising objects and situations, assigning them an emotional value to guide behaviour and making split-second risk/reward assessments.</p><p>The limbic system sits under the cerebrum (the largest and newest part of the brain) and is made up of structures such as the hypothalamus, hippocampus and the amygdala.</p><p>The almond-shaped <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627305008238" class="externalLink">amygdala</a> attaches emotional significance to events and memories. It came to the attention of emotion researchers in 1939 when monkeys whose amygdalae were removed <a href="http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v6/n1/full/4000812a.html" class="externalLink">showed bizarre patterns</a> of behaviour.

Two particular networks that stand out across numerous studies are the autobiographic memory network and cognitive control network.</p><p>The autobiographic memory network processes information related to ourselves, including recalling personal memories and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502540" class="externalLink">self-reflection</a>. </p><p>Key <a href="http://psych.colorado.edu/~hannaje/Publications_&#x26;_CV_files/Andrews-Hanna_Smallwood_Spreng_YCN_2014.pdf" class="externalLink">hubs in this network</a> comprise brain areas inside the prefrontal cortex, which sits in the front of the brain; the hippocampus; the posterior cingulate cortex, which is the upper part of the limbic lobe; and parietal regions, which sit behind the frontal lobe and are important for mental imagery.</p><p>The cognitive control network links up regions that coordinate our attention and concentration so that we can <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661313002222" class="externalLink">complete tasks</a>. It recruits a circuit of <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-011-0083-5" class="externalLink">the front part of the cingulate cortex</a> and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which are specialised for cold, unemotional, rational thought.</p><p>These two networks are thought to have a strained relationship. The autobiographic memory network switches on when someone is preoccupied by thoughts concerning themselves. </p><p>This causes <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2850105/" class="externalLink">the task-oriented cognitive control network to switch off</a>, thereby reducing our ability to complete whatever task we&apos;re supposed to be doing. This is why daydreaming is frowned on at work.</p><p>Conversely, the autobiographic memory network is suppressed when the cognitive control network <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19913622" class="externalLink">is required to gather the attention needed for a task at hand</a>. This is in line with the notion that we &quot;lose ourselves&quot; when we are absorbed doing something.</p><p>When the two networks don&apos;t work properly, they can result in what psychiatrists refer to as <a href="https://theconversation.com/feeling-down-when-does-a-mood-become-a-disorder-14566" class="externalLink">mood disorders</a>.</p><div class="inline-content infographic full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-26/two-types-of-memory/7872930"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/7872930/data/two-types-of-memory-data.png" alt="" title="Two types of memory" width="700" height="498">

It stinks.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Wiggins denied trying to gain an &quot;unfair advantage&quot; in a pre-recorded interview with BBC television broadcast on Sunday. </p><p>&quot;I&apos;ve been a life-long sufferer of asthma and I went to my team doctor at the time and we went, in turn, to a specialist to see if there&apos;s anything else we could do to cure these problems,&quot; Wiggins said.</p><p>&quot;And he said &apos;yeah, there&apos;s something you can do but you&apos;re going to need authorisation from cycling&apos;s governing body&apos;.</p><p>&quot;You have to show and provide evidence from a specialist that they will then scrutinise with three independent doctors and authorise you to take this product. If one of those three doctors says no, you get declined.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;This was to cure a medical condition. This wasn&apos;t about trying to find a way to gain an unfair advantage.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;This was about putting myself back on a level playing-field in order to compete at the highest level,&quot; the five-time Olympic champion added.</p></blockquote><p>A cyber espionage group called &quot;Fancy Bears&quot;, which is believed to be Russian, has been leaking medical data about famous athletes after targeting records held by the World Anti-Doping Agency.</p><p>American tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams, American gymnast Simone Biles and Wiggins&apos;s Team Sky team-mate Chris Froome have also been the subject of leaks.</p><p>The targeted athletes have been revealed to have received TUEs for the use of substances that would usually contravene anti-doping rules.</p><p>TUEs can be issued to athletes who have an illness or condition that requires the use of normally prohibited medication. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by any of the athletes.</p><p><strong>AFP</strong></p>, tiny_mobile_url:, content_summary:[], first_create_date:2016-09-25 19:37:52, web_url:http://abc.net.au/news/7876350, attached_video:[], tiny_web_url:http://ab.co/2cuDw4s, extra:null, id:7876350, article_key:7876350.xml, byline:, updated:2016-09-25 19:37:52, status:Usable]

</a></div><p> </p><p>&quot;Last season was extremely difficult having to go overseas and interstate to play football and having to leave my wife with a sick child to look after. Harley wasn&apos;t doing well and as a family we sensed that we needed that extra support.&quot;</p><p>Kristy has known her husband since high-school and is taking on caring for Harley like any mother would; head-on. Like her spouse, she too carries a steely resolve. But she does it with amazing grace and optimism.</p><p>&quot;It could have been worse to be honest. He has got a little bit sick and we have had to take him into hospital because of that but I think we have been relatively lucky,&quot; Kristy Vukovic says, arms wrapped tightly around Harley while the pair takes time out to watch Danny train.</p><p>In the midst of chronic liver failure, Harley is on the waiting list to receive what the family hopes will be a life-changing operation. There is some risk during surgery, with a 90 per cent long-term survival rate.</p><p>&quot;The best thing we can do is try and live every day as we normally would as a family. Other than pack the hospital bag and be ready we actually try and ignore it on a day to day basis.&quot; she says.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-22/danny-vukovic-in-sydney-fc-training/7868034"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7868030-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Danny Vukovic in Sydney FC training" title="Danny Vukovic in Sydney FC training" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>Kristy leans in close to Harley and waves to Danny from afar. &quot;Can you see Dadda?&quot; she asks. Harley glances out and while he can&apos;t yet talk, his eyes widen and when he sees his Dad waving to him from the goals thirty metres away, he gasps and nods knowingly to his mum. </p><p>&quot;He recognises him on television too. He&apos;ll stop and watch and a big smile will come across his face and he&apos;ll even point at the screen. He gives him a clap too sometimes, especially when Danny walks home from training.&quot;</p><p>But the reality of this situation for Danny and Kristy is that Harley&apos;s life saving phone call is never far away. It could come in hours, days or months.</p><p>&quot;It is pretty scary when you think about it but at least he has hope. We just want him to live a normal life and with a liver transplant he will be able to do that.&quot; Danny Vukovic says.</p><p>&quot;We are on call 24-7. We can&apos;t go on holidays, we can&apos;t travel interstate we always need to sort of be near the hospital. It&apos;s a scary thought because it&apos;s such a huge operation but we want it to happen.&quot;</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;We both have moments where it gets to us.

He snatches the ball from above his head and with seemingly little effort brings it tightly into his chest while landing.</p><p>Vukovic is settling in well to life at Sydney FC.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re in the right environment for everyone now,&quot; Vukovic says, looking out to the Sydney skyline from the FC clubhouse, perched high on a hill overlooking the Macquarie University training fields.</p><p>The former Glory, Victory and Mariners keeper is one of the A-League&apos;s most experienced players, but last season he was granted a release from Victory on compassionate grounds to continue playing.</p><p>Together, Danny and wife Kristy made the decision to come home to give their son Harley, in need of a liver transplant to save his life, the best possible support.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-22/danny-vukovic-in-action-for-perth-glory/7868062"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7868050-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Danny Vukovic in action for Perth Glory" title="Danny Vukovic in action for Perth Glory" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>&quot;Last season was extremely difficult having to go overseas and interstate to play football and having to leave my wife with a sick child to look after. Harley wasn&apos;t doing well and as a family we sensed that we needed that extra support.&quot;</p><p>Kristy has known her husband since high-school and is taking on caring for Harley like any mother would; head-on. Like her spouse, she too carries a steely resolve. But she does it with amazing grace and optimism.</p><p>&quot;It could have been worse to be honest. He has got a little bit sick and we have had to take him into hospital because of that but I think we have been relatively lucky,&quot; Kristy Vukovic says, arms wrapped tightly around Harley while the pair takes time out to watch Danny train.</p><p>In the midst of chronic liver failure, Harley is on the waiting list to receive what the family hopes will be a life-changing operation. There is some risk during surgery, with a 90 per cent long-term survival rate.</p><p>&quot;The best thing we can do is try and live every day as we normally would as a family. Other than pack the hospital bag and be ready we actually try and ignore it on a day to day basis.&quot; she says.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-22/danny-vukovic-in-sydney-fc-training/7868034"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7868030-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Danny Vukovic in Sydney FC training" title="Danny Vukovic in Sydney FC training" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>Kristy leans in close to Harley and waves to Danny from afar. &quot;Can you see Dadda?&quot; she asks. Harley glances out and while he can&apos;t yet talk, his eyes widen and when he sees his Dad waving to him from the goals thirty metres away, he gasps and nods knowingly to his mum. </p><p>&quot;He recognises him on television too. He&apos;ll stop and watch and a big smile will come across his face and he&apos;ll even point at the screen. He gives him a clap too sometimes, especially when Danny walks home from training.&quot;</p><p>But the reality of this situation for Danny and Kristy is that Harley&apos;s life saving phone call is never far away. It could come in hours, days or months.</p><p>&quot;It is pretty scary when you think about it but at least he has hope. We just want him to live a normal life and with a liver transplant he will be able to do that.&quot; Danny Vukovic says.</p><p>&quot;We are on call 24-7. We can&apos;t go on holidays, we can&apos;t travel interstate we always need to sort of be near the hospital. It&apos;s a scary thought because it&apos;s such a huge operation but we want it to happen.&quot;</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;We both have moments where it gets to us.

</div><p> </p><p>Assistant Immigration Minister Alex Hawke said the new temporary sponsored parent visa, which allows people to visit family in Australia for five years at a time, will be in place by July 2017.</p><p>Mr Hawke told reporters in Sydney the Government wanted the new visa program to be more affordable than current arrangements without burdening the taxpayer. </p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;If we are to have more aged parents who have come from overseas here with us visiting or staying, we have to ensure that our already overburdened health system is protected from extra cost,&quot; he said.</p></blockquote><p>&quot;It&apos;s a key issue.&quot; </p><p>The announcement follows a report issued by the Productivity Commission, which recommended the introduction of a temporary visa for parents, which would allow them to stay for a longer period of time as long as the sponsoring child met the necessary health and income costs during their stay.</p><p>The report stated the &quot;cumulated lifetime fiscal costs&quot; of a parent visa holder under the current system was estimated to be between $335,000 and $410,000 per adult in 2015-16.</p><p>&quot;On this basis, the net liability to the Australian community of providing assistance to these 8,700 parents over their lifetime ranges between $2.6 and $3.2 billion in present value terms,&quot; it stated.</p><p>&quot;Given that there is a new inflow each year, the accumulated taxpayer liabilities become very large over time. This is a high cost for a relatively small group.&quot;</p><h4>Visa category may take 30 years to process</h4><p>A discussion paper issued by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection outlined the two categories of parent visas already available, one of which may take &quot;approximately 30 years&quot; to process.</p><p>The other stream is generally finalised within two years.</p><p>&quot;The number of permanent visa places for parents made available in the Migration Programme is small and waiting times can be lengthy,&quot; the paper states.</p><p>&quot;The Government&apos;s intention is that any new temporary parent visa arrangement should help offset these issues, while allowing Australia to benefit socially through having united families and cohesive communities.</p><p>&quot;At the same time, the financial cost of offering a new temporary visa for parents should not become a burden to the Australian community.&quot;</p><p>Mr Hawke said the visa program would be available to parents of Australian citizens, permanent residents and &quot;eligible New Zealand citizens&quot;.</p>, tiny_mobile_url=, content_summary=[], first_create_date=2016-09-23 04:49:36, web_url=http://abc.net.au/news/7872340, attached_video=[], tiny_web_url=http://ab.co/2cpT49B, extra=null, id=7872340, article_key=7872340.xml, byline=political reporter Stephanie Anderson, updated=2016-09-23 04:49:36, status=Usable}

</div><p> </p><p>Assistant Immigration Minister Alex Hawke said the new temporary sponsored parent visa, which allows people to visit family in Australia for five years at a time, will be in place by July 2017.</p><p>Mr Hawke told reporters in Sydney the Government wanted the new visa program to be more affordable than current arrangements without burdening the taxpayer. </p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;If we are to have more aged parents who have come from overseas here with us visiting or staying, we have to ensure that our already overburdened health system is protected from extra cost,&quot; he said.</p></blockquote><p>&quot;It&apos;s a key issue.&quot; </p><p>The announcement follows a report issued by the Productivity Commission, which recommended the introduction of a temporary visa for parents, which would allow them to stay for a longer period of time as long as the sponsoring child met the necessary health and income costs during their stay.</p><p>The report stated the &quot;cumulated lifetime fiscal costs&quot; of a parent visa holder under the current system was estimated to be between $335,000 and $410,000 per adult in 2015-16.</p><p>&quot;On this basis, the net liability to the Australian community of providing assistance to these 8,700 parents over their lifetime ranges between $2.6 and $3.2 billion in present value terms,&quot; it stated.</p><p>&quot;Given that there is a new inflow each year, the accumulated taxpayer liabilities become very large over time. This is a high cost for a relatively small group.&quot;</p><h4>Visa category may take 30 years to process</h4><p>A discussion paper issued by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection outlined the two categories of parent visas already available, one of which may take &quot;approximately 30 years&quot; to process.</p><p>The other stream is generally finalised within two years.</p><p>&quot;The number of permanent visa places for parents made available in the Migration Programme is small and waiting times can be lengthy,&quot; the paper states.</p><p>&quot;The Government&apos;s intention is that any new temporary parent visa arrangement should help offset these issues, while allowing Australia to benefit socially through having united families and cohesive communities.</p><p>&quot;At the same time, the financial cost of offering a new temporary visa for parents should not become a burden to the Australian community.&quot;</p><p>Mr Hawke said the visa program would be available to parents of Australian citizens, permanent residents and &quot;eligible New Zealand citizens&quot;.</p>, tiny_mobile_url:, content_summary:[], first_create_date:2016-09-23 04:49:36, web_url:http://abc.net.au/news/7872340, attached_video:[], tiny_web_url:http://ab.co/2cpT49B, extra:null, id:7872340, article_key:7872340.xml, byline:political reporter Stephanie Anderson, updated:2016-09-23 04:49:36, status:Usable]

</div><p> </p><p>The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) Marion team has been given its marching orders for the end of the year from the GP Plus Health Care centre at Oaklands Park.</p><p>The centre is owned by the Southern Adelaide Local Health Network, which the ABC understands wants to make space for migrating staff from the Repatriation General Hospital at Daw Park ahead of its 2017 closure under the State Government&apos;s Transforming Health platform.</p><p>A health worker within the system said about 12 staff members who provided mental health services to infants, children, adolescents, perinatal women and families at Oaklands Park, were to be relocated nearly 20 kilometres away to Morphett Vale.</p><p>&quot;The expectation is that people [in the Marion area] will have to go to an outreach centre, but at this stage there&apos;s no talk about how that will occur,&quot; the worker said.</p><p>The worker, who wanted to remain anonymous, said the Marion team would be housed in a building with limited clinical facilities adjacent to CAMHS&apos; Onkaparinga team.</p><p>At the same time, CAMHS wanted to lease facilities in Marion to operate an outreach service centre for the staff but had been unable to find anything suitable.</p><p>&quot;If they&apos;re going to the outer area to get cheap accommodation ... it&apos;s very doubtful they&apos;ll provide money for a clinical space back in the Marion catchment area,&quot; the worker said.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;It&apos;s double dipping and defeats the whole purpose. They might as well have just continued to keep looking for an office in the Marion catchment area.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>CAMHS is provided at a number of sites statewide through the State Government&apos;s Women&apos;s and Children&apos;s Health Network (WCHN).</p><p>A WCHN spokeswoman confirmed the lease for the CAMHS site at Marion was ending.</p><p>&quot;It is planned to co-locate the staff office of the Marion Clinical Team with the current service at Morphett Vale,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;These staff will continue to provide clinical services from multiple sites in Marion so that families continue to have access to care.&quot;</p><h4>A bigger plan to &apos;centralise services&apos;</h4><p>The worker said if WHCN did not give a commitment to a proper outreach service in Marion &quot;and at this stage we haven&apos;t heard anything&quot;, client numbers would drop.</p><div class="inline-content photo right"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-23/gp-plus-health-care-centre-at-oaklands-park/7867338"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7867316-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="GP Plus Health Care centre at Oaklands Park" title="GP Plus Health Care centre at Oaklands Park" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>&quot;Then they can justify that they don&apos;t need to provide a service in the area at all,&quot; she said.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;It&apos;s all part of their bigger plan to centralise ... to have one large team at Morphett Vale that services the entire inner and outer southern areas.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>She said clients from the Marion district would likely be forced to complete a 40-kilometre round trip if they wanted to continue getting support from staff that had spent more than 30 years in their community.</p><p>&quot;The only public transport there is a bus, and for people in the Marion area, that might mean several buses, or a train and several buses. </p><p>&quot;For people from areas like Hallett Cove and Aberfoyle Park, it&apos;s about three buses.</p><p>&quot;There will be a huge catchment area where there&apos;s no servicing.&quot;</p><p>The WCHN spokeswoman said she could make it &quot;absolutely clear that there would be no reduction in services provided to children and adolescents in the southern suburbs&quot;.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;CAMHS will continue to provide timely, contemporary evidence-based clinical services in the inner-south,&quot; she said.</p></blockquote><p>&quot;There will be no change in staffing numbers as a result of this move.&quot;</p><p>The worker said community consultation for the latest changes finished on September 30 and consisted only of a &quot;sketchy&quot; questionnaire at the GP Plus centre&apos;s counter.</p><p>She said WCHN was rushing the process through to avoid the same backlash it received when, under Transforming Health, it considered shutting down its <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-25/womens-assessment-service-changes-ruled-out-by-jack-snelling/7785658" target="_self" title="">24-hour women&apos;s assessment service at its North Adelaide hospital</a> before backing down on the plan.</p>, tiny_mobile_url=, content_summary=[inline-photo], first_create_date=2016-09-22 20:50:36, web_url=http://abc.net.au/news/7866112, attached_video=[], tiny_web_url=http://ab.co/2cpfwQb, extra=null, id=7866112, article_key=7866112.xml, byline=Malcolm Sutton, updated=2016-09-23 09:40:14, status=Usable}

<div class="inner"> <h2>Key points:</h2><ul><li>Marion mental health team loses its lease</li><li>Mental health team to be relocated to Morphett Vale</li><li>Plans to operate an outreach centre in Marion remain uncertain</li></ul></div>
</div><p> </p><p>The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) Marion team has been given its marching orders for the end of the year from the GP Plus Health Care centre at Oaklands Park.</p><p>The centre is owned by the Southern Adelaide Local Health Network, which the ABC understands wants to make space for migrating staff from the Repatriation General Hospital at Daw Park ahead of its 2017 closure under the State Government&apos;s Transforming Health platform.</p><p>A health worker within the system said about 12 staff members who provided mental health services to infants, children, adolescents, perinatal women and families at Oaklands Park, were to be relocated nearly 20 kilometres away to Morphett Vale.</p><p>&quot;The expectation is that people [in the Marion area] will have to go to an outreach centre, but at this stage there&apos;s no talk about how that will occur,&quot; the worker said.</p><p>The worker, who wanted to remain anonymous, said the Marion team would be housed in a building with limited clinical facilities adjacent to CAMHS&apos; Onkaparinga team.</p><p>At the same time, CAMHS wanted to lease facilities in Marion to operate an outreach service centre for the staff but had been unable to find anything suitable.</p><p>&quot;If they&apos;re going to the outer area to get cheap accommodation ... it&apos;s very doubtful they&apos;ll provide money for a clinical space back in the Marion catchment area,&quot; the worker said.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;It&apos;s double dipping and defeats the whole purpose. They might as well have just continued to keep looking for an office in the Marion catchment area.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>CAMHS is provided at a number of sites statewide through the State Government&apos;s Women&apos;s and Children&apos;s Health Network (WCHN).</p><p>A WCHN spokeswoman confirmed the lease for the CAMHS site at Marion was ending.</p><p>&quot;It is planned to co-locate the staff office of the Marion Clinical Team with the current service at Morphett Vale,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;These staff will continue to provide clinical services from multiple sites in Marion so that families continue to have access to care.&quot;</p><h4>A bigger plan to &apos;centralise services&apos;</h4><p>The worker said if WHCN did not give a commitment to a proper outreach service in Marion &quot;and at this stage we haven&apos;t heard anything&quot;, client numbers would drop.</p><div class="inline-content photo right"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-23/gp-plus-health-care-centre-at-oaklands-park/7867338"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7867316-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="GP Plus Health Care centre at Oaklands Park" title="GP Plus Health Care centre at Oaklands Park" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>&quot;Then they can justify that they don&apos;t need to provide a service in the area at all,&quot; she said.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;It&apos;s all part of their bigger plan to centralise ... to have one large team at Morphett Vale that services the entire inner and outer southern areas.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>She said clients from the Marion district would likely be forced to complete a 40-kilometre round trip if they wanted to continue getting support from staff that had spent more than 30 years in their community.</p><p>&quot;The only public transport there is a bus, and for people in the Marion area, that might mean several buses, or a train and several buses. </p><p>&quot;For people from areas like Hallett Cove and Aberfoyle Park, it&apos;s about three buses.</p><p>&quot;There will be a huge catchment area where there&apos;s no servicing.&quot;</p><p>The WCHN spokeswoman said she could make it &quot;absolutely clear that there would be no reduction in services provided to children and adolescents in the southern suburbs&quot;.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;CAMHS will continue to provide timely, contemporary evidence-based clinical services in the inner-south,&quot; she said.</p></blockquote><p>&quot;There will be no change in staffing numbers as a result of this move.&quot;</p><p>The worker said community consultation for the latest changes finished on September 30 and consisted only of a &quot;sketchy&quot; questionnaire at the GP Plus centre&apos;s counter.</p><p>She said WCHN was rushing the process through to avoid the same backlash it received when, under Transforming Health, it considered shutting down its <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-25/womens-assessment-service-changes-ruled-out-by-jack-snelling/7785658" target="_self" title="">24-hour women&apos;s assessment service at its North Adelaide hospital</a> before backing down on the plan.</p>, tiny_mobile_url:, content_summary:[inline-photo], first_create_date:2016-09-22 20:50:36, web_url:http://abc.net.au/news/7866112, attached_video:[], tiny_web_url:http://ab.co/2cpfwQb, extra:null, id:7866112, article_key:7866112.xml, byline:Malcolm Sutton, updated:2016-09-23 09:40:14, status:Usable]

Then at touchdown we&apos;re doing 0.9 metres per second, which is about three kilometres an hour,&quot; Mr Holmes said.</p><p>He said the ESA team will know that Rosetta has collided with the comet because the signal it&apos;s transmitting home will suddenly disappear as the high-gain antenna onboard the craft is jolted away from Earth.</p><p>&quot;When we crash, that high gain antenna will jolt massively, and it will just lose the Earth&apos;s transmission,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;There&apos;s no electronics that could then re-acquire the signal.&quot;</p><h4>On a collision course with the Ma&apos;at region</h4><p>The scientists have calculated Rosetta will land on the Ma&apos;at region on the head of the duck-shaped comet.</p><p>As it descends to the planned landing point, Rosetta will take measurements of the dust, plasma, and gas in the environment close to the surface, as well as high-resolution photographs of mysterious pit holes in the comet.</p><p>The Ma&apos;at region is of particular interest to scientists because those pit holes haven&apos;t been seen anywhere else in our solar system.</p><p>Some pits in the area run up to 60 metres deep and might allow scientists to peer inside of the comet, giving clues as to how comets form.</p><p>&quot;They don&apos;t exist on any other planetary body in our system, we&apos;ve never seen them before,&quot; Mr Holmes said.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re going to be seeing millimetre-level resolution from these very powerful Osiris cameras that we have on Rosetta.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/the-ma&#x27;at-region/7877364"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7877364-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="An image showing the Ma&#x27;at region of comet 67P" title="The Ma&#x27;at region" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>Exactly what is revealed will depend on the images captured by Rosetta in its last moments.</p><p>Scientists still aren&apos;t sure exactly how the gravity of the comet close-by to the surface will affect the spacecraft, and they&apos;re also concerned about how dust and gas spewing from the comet might affect its trajectory.</p><p>But the ESA is predicting the craft will land relatively close to the point on the comet it&apos;s aiming at despite these uncertainties.</p><h4>Rosetta an &apos;ark of humanity&apos;</h4><p>Despite the low gravity of the comet, Rosetta should remain on its surface for billions of years if nothing disturbs it.</p><p>Mr Holmes said the craft is a veritable &quot;ark of humanity,&quot; because its insides contained the human DNA of all those who had worked on assembling it.</p><p>&quot;Humans, myself included, spent dozens of hours deep inside the spacecraft doing all the electrical connections and the electrical testing ... I know many times I was sneezing or coughing,&quot; he said.</p><p>He hoped Rosetta might one day be recovered and opened up to find the preserved DNA of the people who worked on the craft.</p><p>&quot;The decision&apos;s now been made to put Rosetta down onto the surface, and as a consequence it&apos;s become a Noah&apos;s ark of human DNA, for aliens or future humans to go up and clone us all over again.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content wysiwyg full">

</a></div><p> </p><h4>Love of collecting linked to migrant history</h4><p>For Daniella Trimboli, a researcher in diasporic cultures and digital storytelling, the exciting thing about the Foundling Archive is the way it extends Australia&apos;s immigration story beyond the dominant narrative.</p><p>&quot;These more everyday things enable us to see the complexities and differences that people actually experience in their day-to-day lives, that we wouldn&apos;t normally get an insight into,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s not &apos;you settle and you live a happy life&apos;. It&apos;s actually back and forth, memories and reconnections, new connections with other migrants and your community here.&quot;</p><p>Ms Lolicato said her own love of collecting was linked to her background as a member of the Italian diaspora.</p><p>&quot;When you don&apos;t have a longstanding history of being on the Australian landscape, when your family has come from somewhere else, what happens is they bring these trinkets with them,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;In the pre-digital age, when people were sending things through mail, the photographs and the letters that you got were so precious.</p><p>&quot;I think that I always felt a sense of reverence or respect or authority for those trinkets and other pieces of paper and photography because they were always discussed with me as something that represented something greater than the bit of paper they were written on.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/katrina-lolicato-at-the-launch-of-the-foundling-archive/7884690"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7884680-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A woman with dark hair speaks to two women wearing headscarves at an event opening." title="Katrina Lolicato at the launch of the Foundling Archive" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><h4>Digital age puts old artefacts in new context</h4><p>But the digital age puts these trinkets into a new context. Though you can still buy postcards, many families keep in touch by posting their holiday photos on Facebook instead. Home videos are more likely to exist in the cloud than on a VHS tape gathering dust on the mantelpiece.</p><p>&quot;Those time and space divides that made those objects so precious &#x2014; we don&apos;t have that; we can connect immediately,&quot; Ms Lolicato said.</p><p>&quot;We place different meanings now on those kinds of objects and those interactions as well.&quot;</p><p>Dr Trimboli said it enables new kinds of stories to be heard. And outside of the big capital city museums, a more nuanced story of Australian migration and multiculturalism can emerge.</p><p>&quot;When you start looking at the way that other people are taking on digital forms and creating their own kinds of stories, really interesting things start to happen,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;You pick up on all these other things that you didn&apos;t hear about before, and also it allows for different kinds of connections as well, because people find this space where they can relate to something that someone else has shared.</p><p>&quot;It just allows for a different kind of mediation that&apos;s not often seen through these bigger institutions.&quot;</p><p><strong><em>Listen to the full interview with Katrina Lolicato and Daniella Trimboli on The Drawing Room at 7:15pm on RN, or subscribe to the podcast on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/drawing-room-program-podcast/id644052724?mt=2" class="externalLink">iTunes</a>, the <a href="https://radio.abc.net.au/help/apps">ABC Radio</a> app or your favourite <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/feed/4658720/podcast.xml" target="_self" title="">podcasting app</a> to listen later.</em></strong></p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/photo-found-at-market-in-lygon-street/7884662"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7884648-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A photo found at the Lost and Found market in Lygon Street, Brunswick East, between April 2013 and September 2013." title="Photo found at market in Lygon Street" width="340" height="227">

We fight like girls. This is how we prevail. And this is why we&apos;re still standing.&quot;</p><p>Ford spoke with Baird about whether feminism should make room for men, why women need to silence their inner critics, and how we can all stand up for ourselves online. </p><p><em>The following is an edited, condensed version of their conversation. </em></p><p><strong><em>Baird: What does it mean to &quot;fight like a girl&quot;? Do girls fight differently, is that what you&apos;re saying?</em></strong></p><p>Ford: Traditionally, to do anything like a girl &#x2026; is to be rubbish at it. Because girls are rubbish, and girls are pointless, and unless girls are servicing some other kind of patriarchal ideal, then what&apos;s the point of us at all? </p><p>It&apos;s that old quote &#x2014; I&apos;m paraphrasing it, but &#x2014; &quot;the rent we need to pay in order to have any kind of voice&quot;. And when I started to think more about that, I heard it instead as, &quot;well, if I [a man] have to listen to you, then you [a woman] have to give me something to at least look at&quot;.</p><p>So the idea that &quot;to fight like a girl&quot; is a play, not just on the fact that people think that girls are rubbish but &#x2026; is testament to how strong women are and how vigorously we fight just to exist day to day, with all of the violence that is enacted against us, with all of the hostility, the brutality. And we are still here and still standing. </p><p><strong><em>Just listening to you, I was thinking about the song during the depression about &quot;don&apos;t be polite, girls, show a little fight&quot;. The women of the Second Wave (of feminism) used to sing it, and their grandmothers had sung it to them. Every generation, it seems, needs to be told this message again. What is it that needs to be said now? </em></strong></p><p>There are multiple things that need to be said. But one of the primary things we all need to absorb is that liberation, for [women], won&apos;t happen by being polite. </p><p>It took me a long time to realise that being nice to men &#x2014; and when I say men I mean individual men, but also the structural dominance of patriarchy &#x2014; being nice to the system isn&apos;t going to get anything for women. Why would the system collapse itself just because women asked nicely? </p><p>So the analogy I often use is of a pond. If you are looking at a pond and you want to change the surface area of the pond, you&apos;re not going to do it by asking the pond nicely &#x2014; you do it by throwing a rock into the middle of the pond. And that&apos;s why I feel what, very simply, we have to do. </p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/clementine-ford-in-conversation-with-julia-baird/7880808"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880338-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Clementine Ford in conversation with Julia Baird at the Athenaeum, Melbourne on September 26, 2016." title="Clementine Ford in conversation with Julia Baird" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>I often have men wagging their fingers in my face and saying, &quot;Well, you&apos;ll never get men onside if you&apos;re not nice to them. How can you change men&apos;s minds if you&apos;re not nice to them?&quot;</p><p>But I don&apos;t give a f*** about men. I&apos;m not trying to change men&apos;s minds, I&apos;m trying to talk to women. I write for women. and I think that&apos;s a beautiful thing to be proud of. I don&apos;t f***ing care what men think about it. </p><p><strong><em>A lot of this book, it feels like, has been shaped in combat. What was the first point at which you thought, &quot;I&apos;m in a fight and I&apos;m going to take this on&quot;?</em></strong></p><p>It&apos;s almost <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/conviction-inside-the-hunt-for-jill-meagher&#x27;s-killer/7864120" target="_self" title="">four years to the day that Jill Meagher was killed in Brunswick</a>. And not just for me, but I think for Melbourne, that was a huge turning point. </p><div class="inline-content photo right"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/poster-of-missing-abc-melbourne-employee-jill-meagher-on-septem/7881570"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/4277818-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A poster of missing ABC employee Jill Meagher in Brunswick, Melbourne, on September 24, 2012. " title="A poster of missing ABC employee Jill Meagher" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>When [Jill] was found, it suddenly brought a sense of reality that this thing had happened to this woman, but then came the week of victim-blaming &#x2014; you know, articles about &quot;Why did she walk home that way?&quot; or &quot;Why did she walk home through Brunswick, through those derelict streets of dingy warehouses?&quot;</p><p>Adrian Bayley made the choice to rape and murder a woman. And if it hadn&apos;t been her, then it would have been someone else that night. </p><p>And that&apos;s fundamentally what it comes down to: realising that, when you say things to women like, &quot;Well, why did you walk down there, why did you dress this way?&quot;, that&apos;s taking the emphasis off the men who are choosing to do these things to women. </p><p>We need to be able to name those things and I think, for me, Jill Meagher&apos;s murder was really the turning point. I was so angry that women were still being told that these things were fundamentally our fault.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/a-woman-at-clem-ford&#x27;s-book-launch/7880988"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880356-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Women in the audience of Clementine Ford&#x27;s book launch in Melbourne." title="A woman at Clem Ford&#x27;s book launch" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p><strong><em>Was another turning point your Sunrise moment? That was a point of acceleration for you &#x2014; taking on the public shaming of women.</em></strong></p><p>I received so many cracker comments like, &quot;I&apos;ve seen better tits on a pit-bull&quot;. Someone told me that they hoped I would sit on a butcher&apos;s knife so I&apos;d never reproduce. </p><p>But I feel like I&apos;ve got such a thick skin about that stuff [online abuse] now that I just really don&apos;t care. I feel it keenly when I see men saying those things to other women &#x2014; it really upsets me and hurts me and I want to go in there and protect them &#x2014; but when they say it to me, I just know how to deal with it.</p><p>I know that it is not going to silence me or shut me up and if anything just makes me laugh at them.</p><p><strong><em>What do you think the huge response to that post was about? What is it about you publicly calling sexism out that women are responding to?</em></strong></p><p>Firstly, that someone is legitimising my own thoughts, that have always been framed to me as irrelevant or irrational or non-existent, that they might just be in my own head. But then here&apos;s this person saying the same things I think, and maybe I&apos;m not crazy. </p><div class="inline-content photo right"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/amy-schumer-stockholm-show/7881590"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7814410-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Amy Schumer at Stockholm show" title="Amy Schumer at Stockholm show" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>But also, just a sense of, &quot;Well, why do we have to put up with this bullshit all the time? Why do we have to sit there while men degrade and laugh at us, while we just sit there and laugh along?&quot;</p><p>Because if we don&apos;t laugh at the massive joke that is us, then we are being a buzz-kill, or a downer or a &quot;feminazi bitch&quot; or whatever. </p><p>I&apos;ve sat there and laughed so many times when men have told sexist jokes in front of me because I know that I&apos;m not supposed to say, &quot;hey, I don&apos;t think that it&apos;s funny&quot;. </p><p>I feel like it&apos;s gotten to the point where the more women we see saying, &quot;shut up&quot; or &quot;no, I&apos;m not going to tolerate that&quot;, the easier it is for us all to do. Seeing someone else say &quot;I don&apos;t like it&quot; helps make us feel big again. </p><p><strong><em>One question you get asked a lot by men is about what their role is [in feminism], and why don&apos;t you allow them a space. </em></strong></p><p>Once upon a time, I would have sat in a room full of people like this and said: &quot;Thank you to all of the men who came tonight, all five of you. It&apos;s so great to have you here, you&apos;re such great guys.&quot; </p><p>That is something that feminists are inclined towards doing. Because if we&apos;re not nice to men, if we don&apos;t create space for men in feminism, then they&apos;ll leave. </p><p>Men are not doing anything for feminism now in terms of dismantling the patriarchy, so I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to be a huge loss. </p><div class="inline-content right"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BK0IXaaBrPk/" class="externalLink"><span><strong>External Link:</strong> Melissa Wellham on Instagram</span> </a></div><p> </p><p><strong><em>What about in history? With suffrage, you had to persuade some men to vote it through. You had to have some blokes on side.</em></strong></p><p>That may be true, but I don&apos;t think we should make a big song and dance about it. Feminism still has to make room for so many different kinds of women before it concerns itself with making room for men. </p><p>If men want to be on board with feminism, that&apos;s great. But don&apos;t sit there and put your hands out for your medals and your cookies. </p><p>It&apos;s an impulse that we all have as humans to want to be rewarded for our generosity and kindness. But when we feel that, we need to engage with that feeling and stamp it down. </p><p>We need to resist that urge to want to be rewarded for doing the basic right thing. Because if we have to keep acknowledging and thanking men for giving us respect, if we have to keep thanking them and saying, &quot;it&apos;s so great that you&apos;re here, you&apos;re such a good guy&quot; &#x2026; at what point are we allowed to stop doing that?</p><p><strong><em>There does seem to be a preoccupation with how feminism makes men feel ... </em></strong></p><p>We are too preoccupied as a society with wondering what men think about everything. </p><p>What do men think about feminism? What do men think about Ghostbusters? What do men think about my dress? What do men think about the fact that women paint their nails? What do men think about Hillary Clinton? </p><p>Who cares?! I don&apos;t care what men think, I really don&apos;t, and I feel like we all need to get to that point where we say: &quot;I will choose to care about this person&apos;s feelings, but I am not going to care about what men think generally about something.&quot;</p><p>Women and women&apos;s interests don&apos;t become legitimate when a man is suddenly paying attention to them. </p><div class="inline-content photo right"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/rosie-the-riveter/7881640"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/1890648-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Rosie the Riveter" title="Rosie the Riveter" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p><strong><em>Anne Summers says in the foreword to her book Damned Whores and God&apos;s Police that women have real internal battles to fight, that we need to reinvent new selves other than mother and wife. What do you think when you hear her say that we still haven&apos;t unknotted our own thinking?</em></strong></p><p>Women have been told for so long by other people what we are supposed to be. </p><p>We learn very early on to look at ourselves through the male gaze. And it&apos;s impossible to separate ourselves from that. I don&apos;t care if someone calls me fat, because firstly, I don&apos;t think there is anything wrong with being fat. </p><p>But I do still suffer from that conditioned idea of what my body is supposed to look like, to the point that I do feel self-conscious when I walk down the street. I do think, &quot;are people looking at me thinking that I&apos;m too fat to wear this?&quot; or whatever it might be. </p><p><strong><em>The other day I emailed a very prominent woman who has got several degrees </em></strong>&#x2014; <strong><em>she just smashes it out of the park professionally. And I said: &quot;Can you come on my show?&quot; And she said: &quot;I&apos;ve put on too much weight.&quot; These things are so powerful in preventing women from speaking.</em></strong></p><p>The better question, for me, is, &quot;How do we learn to see ourselves with our own eyes? How do we use our own eyes to look at the world?&quot;, which is a process I&apos;m still figuring out because those messages are so deeply engrained. </p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/the-audience-at-clementine-ford&#x27;s-book-launch/7880814"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880348-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="People in the audience at the launch of Clementine Ford&#x27;s book Fight Like A Girl hold up their copies." title="The audience at Clementine Ford&#x27;s book launch" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>You can know it intellectually, but it&apos;s really hard to divorce yourself from that little 10-year-old girl who learns that she&apos;s fat for the first time, or learns that other people think that she&apos;s fat and what that word [fat] means. </p><p>Women turn down opportunities for all kinds of reasons. And so we need to learn how to look at ourselves through different eyes and quiet those inner voices. We might not be able to get rid of them completely, but we need to figure out how to become stronger than it.</p><p><strong><em>You are a technological warrior, which I think is a new frontier. How do you think women should fight online?</em></strong></p><p>Don&apos;t give a f***. Just be brazen. Really, more than anything, understand that it&apos;s your space as well, and you&apos;re entitled to be there. We are all entitled to take up space. </p><p>Women are trained from early on to figuratively and literally avoid taking up too much room, but we need to do the opposite of that now, and to figure out how to take up as much room as possible. </p><div class="inline-content wysiwyg right">

</div><p> </p><p>One of the great things that I see happening on the internet now is that it&apos;s enabled women to globally connect with each other. So that not only can they support one another, they can actually see each other.</p><p>The problem that we are facing now, though, is that feminism is becoming exploitable by capitalism. We now look at feminism as something that can be sold, and we need to be very conscious of that. </p><p>Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull and Alan Jones can all sit there and say that they&apos;re feminists because they know that, as men &#x2014; in a capitalist world where feminism now has currency amongst women &#x2014; when they say they&apos;re a feminist, they do it because it gives them more space and entitlement to speak. </p><p>And when women say that they&apos;re still feminists, it decreases the right that we have to speak, because it positions us as only one thing. </p><p>So we need to be really conscious about who&apos;s using feminism and how they&apos;re using it and be really radical. We need a re-imagined radical feminism for the modern world. </p><div class="inline-content html-fragment full"> </div><p> </p>, tiny_mobile_url=, content_summary=[inline-photo, inline-html-fragment], first_create_date=2016-09-27 03:12:37, web_url=http://abc.net.au/news/7880234, attached_video=[], tiny_web_url=http://ab.co/2cxLF86, extra=null, id=7880234, article_key=7880234.xml, byline=, updated=2016-09-27 04:57:23, status=Usable}

And this is why we&apos;re still standing.&quot;</p><p>Ford spoke with Baird about whether feminism should make room for men, why women need to silence their inner critics, and how we can all stand up for ourselves online. </p><p><em>The following is an edited, condensed version of their conversation. </em></p><p><strong><em>Baird: What does it mean to &quot;fight like a girl&quot;? Do girls fight differently, is that what you&apos;re saying?</em></strong></p><p>Ford: Traditionally, to do anything like a girl &#x2026; is to be rubbish at it. Because girls are rubbish, and girls are pointless, and unless girls are servicing some other kind of patriarchal ideal, then what&apos;s the point of us at all? </p><p>It&apos;s that old quote &#x2014; I&apos;m paraphrasing it, but &#x2014; &quot;the rent we need to pay in order to have any kind of voice&quot;. And when I started to think more about that, I heard it instead as, &quot;well, if I [a man] have to listen to you, then you [a woman] have to give me something to at least look at&quot;.</p><p>So the idea that &quot;to fight like a girl&quot; is a play, not just on the fact that people think that girls are rubbish but &#x2026; is testament to how strong women are and how vigorously we fight just to exist day to day, with all of the violence that is enacted against us, with all of the hostility, the brutality. And we are still here and still standing. </p><p><strong><em>Just listening to you, I was thinking about the song during the depression about &quot;don&apos;t be polite, girls, show a little fight&quot;. The women of the Second Wave (of feminism) used to sing it, and their grandmothers had sung it to them. Every generation, it seems, needs to be told this message again. What is it that needs to be said now? </em></strong></p><p>There are multiple things that need to be said. But one of the primary things we all need to absorb is that liberation, for [women], won&apos;t happen by being polite. </p><p>It took me a long time to realise that being nice to men &#x2014; and when I say men I mean individual men, but also the structural dominance of patriarchy &#x2014; being nice to the system isn&apos;t going to get anything for women. Why would the system collapse itself just because women asked nicely? </p><p>So the analogy I often use is of a pond. If you are looking at a pond and you want to change the surface area of the pond, you&apos;re not going to do it by asking the pond nicely &#x2014; you do it by throwing a rock into the middle of the pond. And that&apos;s why I feel what, very simply, we have to do. </p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/clementine-ford-in-conversation-with-julia-baird/7880808"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880338-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Clementine Ford in conversation with Julia Baird at the Athenaeum, Melbourne on September 26, 2016." title="Clementine Ford in conversation with Julia Baird" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>I often have men wagging their fingers in my face and saying, &quot;Well, you&apos;ll never get men onside if you&apos;re not nice to them.

</a></div><p> </p><p>When [Jill] was found, it suddenly brought a sense of reality that this thing had happened to this woman, but then came the week of victim-blaming &#x2014; you know, articles about &quot;Why did she walk home that way?&quot; or &quot;Why did she walk home through Brunswick, through those derelict streets of dingy warehouses?&quot;</p><p>Adrian Bayley made the choice to rape and murder a woman. And if it hadn&apos;t been her, then it would have been someone else that night. </p><p>And that&apos;s fundamentally what it comes down to: realising that, when you say things to women like, &quot;Well, why did you walk down there, why did you dress this way?&quot;, that&apos;s taking the emphasis off the men who are choosing to do these things to women. </p><p>We need to be able to name those things and I think, for me, Jill Meagher&apos;s murder was really the turning point. I was so angry that women were still being told that these things were fundamentally our fault.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/a-woman-at-clem-ford&#x27;s-book-launch/7880988"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880356-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Women in the audience of Clementine Ford&#x27;s book launch in Melbourne." title="A woman at Clem Ford&#x27;s book launch" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p><strong><em>Was another turning point your Sunrise moment? That was a point of acceleration for you &#x2014; taking on the public shaming of women.</em></strong></p><p>I received so many cracker comments like, &quot;I&apos;ve seen better tits on a pit-bull&quot;. Someone told me that they hoped I would sit on a butcher&apos;s knife so I&apos;d never reproduce. </p><p>But I feel like I&apos;ve got such a thick skin about that stuff [online abuse] now that I just really don&apos;t care. I feel it keenly when I see men saying those things to other women &#x2014; it really upsets me and hurts me and I want to go in there and protect them &#x2014; but when they say it to me, I just know how to deal with it.</p><p>I know that it is not going to silence me or shut me up and if anything just makes me laugh at them.</p><p><strong><em>What do you think the huge response to that post was about? What is it about you publicly calling sexism out that women are responding to?</em></strong></p><p>Firstly, that someone is legitimising my own thoughts, that have always been framed to me as irrelevant or irrational or non-existent, that they might just be in my own head. But then here&apos;s this person saying the same things I think, and maybe I&apos;m not crazy. </p><div class="inline-content photo right"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/amy-schumer-stockholm-show/7881590"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7814410-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Amy Schumer at Stockholm show" title="Amy Schumer at Stockholm show" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>But also, just a sense of, &quot;Well, why do we have to put up with this bullshit all the time? Why do we have to sit there while men degrade and laugh at us, while we just sit there and laugh along?&quot;</p><p>Because if we don&apos;t laugh at the massive joke that is us, then we are being a buzz-kill, or a downer or a &quot;feminazi bitch&quot; or whatever. </p><p>I&apos;ve sat there and laughed so many times when men have told sexist jokes in front of me because I know that I&apos;m not supposed to say, &quot;hey, I don&apos;t think that it&apos;s funny&quot;. </p><p>I feel like it&apos;s gotten to the point where the more women we see saying, &quot;shut up&quot; or &quot;no, I&apos;m not going to tolerate that&quot;, the easier it is for us all to do. Seeing someone else say &quot;I don&apos;t like it&quot; helps make us feel big again. </p><p><strong><em>One question you get asked a lot by men is about what their role is [in feminism], and why don&apos;t you allow them a space. </em></strong></p><p>Once upon a time, I would have sat in a room full of people like this and said: &quot;Thank you to all of the men who came tonight, all five of you. It&apos;s so great to have you here, you&apos;re such great guys.&quot; </p><p>That is something that feminists are inclined towards doing. Because if we&apos;re not nice to men, if we don&apos;t create space for men in feminism, then they&apos;ll leave. </p><p>Men are not doing anything for feminism now in terms of dismantling the patriarchy, so I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to be a huge loss. </p><div class="inline-content right"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BK0IXaaBrPk/" class="externalLink"><span><strong>External Link:</strong> Melissa Wellham on Instagram</span> </a></div><p> </p><p><strong><em>What about in history? With suffrage, you had to persuade some men to vote it through. You had to have some blokes on side.</em></strong></p><p>That may be true, but I don&apos;t think we should make a big song and dance about it. Feminism still has to make room for so many different kinds of women before it concerns itself with making room for men. </p><p>If men want to be on board with feminism, that&apos;s great. But don&apos;t sit there and put your hands out for your medals and your cookies. </p><p>It&apos;s an impulse that we all have as humans to want to be rewarded for our generosity and kindness. But when we feel that, we need to engage with that feeling and stamp it down. </p><p>We need to resist that urge to want to be rewarded for doing the basic right thing. Because if we have to keep acknowledging and thanking men for giving us respect, if we have to keep thanking them and saying, &quot;it&apos;s so great that you&apos;re here, you&apos;re such a good guy&quot; &#x2026; at what point are we allowed to stop doing that?</p><p><strong><em>There does seem to be a preoccupation with how feminism makes men feel ... </em></strong></p><p>We are too preoccupied as a society with wondering what men think about everything. </p><p>What do men think about feminism?

How do we use our own eyes to look at the world?&quot;, which is a process I&apos;m still figuring out because those messages are so deeply engrained. </p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/the-audience-at-clementine-ford&#x27;s-book-launch/7880814"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880348-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="People in the audience at the launch of Clementine Ford&#x27;s book Fight Like A Girl hold up their copies." title="The audience at Clementine Ford&#x27;s book launch" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>You can know it intellectually, but it&apos;s really hard to divorce yourself from that little 10-year-old girl who learns that she&apos;s fat for the first time, or learns that other people think that she&apos;s fat and what that word [fat] means. </p><p>Women turn down opportunities for all kinds of reasons.

Really, more than anything, understand that it&apos;s your space as well, and you&apos;re entitled to be there.

</div><p> </p><p>One of the great things that I see happening on the internet now is that it&apos;s enabled women to globally connect with each other. So that not only can they support one another, they can actually see each other.</p><p>The problem that we are facing now, though, is that feminism is becoming exploitable by capitalism. We now look at feminism as something that can be sold, and we need to be very conscious of that. </p><p>Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull and Alan Jones can all sit there and say that they&apos;re feminists because they know that, as men &#x2014; in a capitalist world where feminism now has currency amongst women &#x2014; when they say they&apos;re a feminist, they do it because it gives them more space and entitlement to speak. </p><p>And when women say that they&apos;re still feminists, it decreases the right that we have to speak, because it positions us as only one thing. </p><p>So we need to be really conscious about who&apos;s using feminism and how they&apos;re using it and be really radical.

</div></p><p>The Social Outfit is modelled on a similar Melbourne business and in its two-year lifetime has trained and employed staff from over 21 countries &#x2014; mainly from areas where there is conflict or a history of conflict.</p><p>Bleh Wah, originally from Burma, lived in a refugee camp for years before arriving in Australia eight years ago.</p><p>&quot;When I was in the refugee camp I was sewing a little bit for my family, neighbours, friends and other people at my home.&quot;</p><p>She studied at the Social Outfit&apos;s sewing school and is now employed as one of its main sewing technicians.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/the-social-outfit-bleh-wah/7878420"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7878418-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A woman sewing a piece of fabric." title="The Social Outfit workroom" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>The Social Outfit&apos;s focus isn&apos;t just on sewing skills; the organisation also aims to increase their staff&apos;s understanding of their rights in an Australian workplace.</p><p>&quot;We spend a lot of time with our students and staff talking about basic things like working conditions, what Australian contracts look like, what superannuation is,&quot; says Ms Ruddock. </p><p>&quot;Sewing or selling is a big part of what we do but we&apos;re also talking about just how it is to be in Australia, what it&apos;s like to be in this community.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/the-social-outfit-ruck-sar/7878490"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7878470-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A young woman standing in front of brightly coloured fabric." title="The Social Outfit" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>One of the shop assistants is Ruck Sar, who at 22 has recently arrived in Australia with her family from South East Asia.</p><p>&quot;Working here is like working in a family shop, it&apos;s like my boss treats me like a little sister, all the members are really patient and really comfortable to talk,&quot; she says.</p><p>Eloise Rapp, the organisation&apos;s creative director, points out that The Social Outfit is also environmentally sustainable; 50 per cent of the fabric used to make the clothing is industry donated.</p><p>&quot;There are quite a few issues surrounding wastage in the fashion industry and one of them is just excess fabric,&quot; she says.</p><p>&quot;With fashion labels there&apos;s an issue with limited storage space and with the speed of commercial fashion seasons, the turnover of fabrics often means a lot of labels are left with excess fabric that they don&apos;t know what to do with and it just goes into landfill.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/the-social-outfit-clothing/7878512"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7878498-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A model wears a brightly coloured dress and top." title="The Social Outfit clothing-1" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>So rather than high-quality fabric going straight to landfill, The Social Outfit gives it a second life.</p><p>While The Social Outfit relies on independent grants and philanthropic donations, roughly a quarter of the organisations revenue comes from product sales. </p><p>&quot;You can never underestimate what it&apos;s like for all of us and for our staff when you sell a piece of clothing because it&apos;s very literal &#x2014; the money goes from the sale of that piece of clothing straight back into the business.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/the-social-outfit-fabric/7878546"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7878516-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A piece of brightly coloured fabric." title="The Social Outfit fabric" width="340" height="227">

Though it has been 30 years since she published a book, she continues to produce work that is unashamedly personal and political.</p><p>&quot;I didn&apos;t stop trying to get my work published, there wasn&apos;t that interest in my sort of stuff and that was fine. I guess I don&apos;t really have a huge ambition,&quot; says Mary Leunig.</p><p>But there are advantages to laying low.</p><p>&quot;The thing about not being published is that you are pretty free to do what you want. I&apos;m not doing this for anybody.&quot;</p><p>Mary is a self-described recluse. She lives on a quiet property in Merton, Victoria, overlooking the stunning Strathbogie Ranges.</p><p>&quot;I think I just wanted not to be known, to shut everything down and be left alone.&quot;</p><h4>The art of inspiring blood and guts</h4><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/corporate-gore/7880270"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880240-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A businessman stands impaled by a dozen spears in a cartoon by Mary Leunig" title="Corporate gore" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>Several radios blast the ABC from different corners of Mary&apos;s kitchen. It&apos;s an effort to combat the buzzing tinnitus in her ears, and the news provides inspiration for her craft.</p><p>Mary&apos;s shoulders are sore from hunching over the kitchen table. She looks through a giant magnifying glass to see the severed head she&apos;s brought to life &#x2014; or death, as the case may be.</p><p>She&apos;s at pains to point out that while her work is often politically charged, it just as often isn&apos;t. Once, a reviewer described her drawing of a woman in a swastika dress as a comment on the fascist nature of housework.</p><p>&quot;I just designed a swastika dress and wanted to put it in a picture,&quot; she says.</p><p>&quot;I refer to my work as drawing. If they&apos;re referred to as cartoons, there is the expectation that they have a meaning.&quot;</p><p>Growing up in the working-class western suburbs of Melbourne shaped both Mary and Michael. Their parents were employed at a local meatworks and their father was a union delegate.</p><p>Another strong theme in her work is women and power &#x2014; she describes herself as a radical feminist and likes to depict corporate figures naked or humiliated.</p><p>Blood and guts are a common thread. Sometimes subtle, but mostly confronting, her work isn&apos;t the sort of thing you&apos;d hang over your dinner table.</p><p>&quot;I enjoy the sort of work I do because it&apos;s not the sort of work that a nice woman or a nice lady should do. I do decapitations; I don&apos;t mind doing it, especially if it&apos;s Rupert Murdoch.<div class="inline-content wysiwyg right">

</div></p><p>&quot;In a way I&apos;m trying to encourage young girls out there at state school to draw as much blood and guts as you possibly can.&quot;</p><p>But don&apos;t expect to get your hands on a copy of a Mary Leunig original any time soon. She refuses to sell prints because &quot;she doesn&apos;t want to rob people&quot; and is reluctant to part with originals.</p><p>Someone wrote to her recently asking to purchase a drawing. She said she wouldn&apos;t know what to charge but would send him one for free.</p><p>&quot;He wrote back and asked me if I like salami. I&apos;m going to give him a drawing and he&apos;s going to send me salami&quot;.</p><h4>The Leunig experience</h4><p>The birth of Mary&apos;s first child was memorable, of course. She recalls being the same age as the midwife who looked after her. During the delivery she asked about one of Mary&apos;s brother&apos;s cartoons.</p><p>&quot;She goes through this whole f***ing poem of Michael&apos;s as I&apos;m giving birth,&quot; says Mary. &quot;She was gorgeous and she really wanted to know what it meant and she said: &apos;He must be wonderful.&apos;&quot;</p><p>Mary reckons it was just another &quot;Leunig experience&quot;.</p><p>Michael Leunig&apos;s cartoons, poems and calendars have appeared in newspapers for over 40 years. His success is something Mary and her family have enjoyed.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re very proud of Michael,&quot; she says. &quot;He&apos;s a really clever person. He&apos;s great with ideas, really humorous. So for all of us it was really wonderful&quot;.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/gough-whitlam-and-vincent-lingiari/7880264"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880244-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Gough Whitlam hands Vincent Lingiari a handful of soil in a cartoon by Mary Leunig" title="Gough Whitlam and Vincent Lingiari" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>But to avoid any bother with over-zealous Leunig fans, Mary often goes by &quot;Mary Baker&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m an artist &#x2014; I like artists and their process,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s ridiculous being jealous of Michael. His work&apos;s really good. I wouldn&apos;t even try to do what Michael does, I like what I do.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t understand this thing he&apos;s got about gentleness because he can be just as brutal as anyone. Maybe that&apos;s why he&apos;s all gentle in his work. And maybe I&apos;m really gentle and I draw decapitated heads. You&apos;re not necessarily about what you project.</p><p>&quot;There&apos;s a type of humour that we share sometimes, which is probably just a basic working class humour.&quot;</p><p>The Leunig name is now cemented in Australia art &#x2014; many other members of the family, including Michael&apos;s children, work in creative industries.</p><h4>Self-expression at a cost</h4><p>In the early 70s, Mary&apos;s parents moved from suburban Melbourne to a small Victorian town called Daylesford.</p><p>&quot;There was a dream I guess. We could move up there, gradually all my siblings could go up there, have kids, it would be an extended family, it would work,&quot; she says.</p><p>And that&apos;s what happened, for a while.</p><p>&quot;There was always something kind of wrong. It wasn&apos;t working out perfectly.&quot;</p><p>They began fighting and Mary stopped talking to certain members of her family, including her parents.</p><p>&quot;We became estranged and it was pretty terrible and there was nothing that could be done about it,&quot; she says. &quot;We still stayed there, and even though my parents lived just down the hill, there was no talking.&quot;</p><p>After her parents died she used art to help her express her feeling.</p><p>&quot;You just get so used to not communicating with that person that it becomes permanent,&quot; she says.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/family-life/7880328"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880326-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Mary Leunig and her children in a cartoon by Mary Leunig" title="Family life" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>Mary has had an off and on relationship with Michael. In an unfortunate turn of events, she&apos;s had less contact with her children, who are now in their 40s, in recent years. Arguments led both sides to stop talking.</p><p>&quot;I thought OK, that&apos;s alright. But then I did a few drawings involving my kids and they really disliked me for it.&quot;</p><p>But the drawings &#x2014; like the ones with her parents and Michael &#x2014; are Mary&apos;s way of dealing with family life and its ups and downs.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m inclined to think that for me to go a little bit public with my personal feelings about estrangement and maybe failure as a mother, I think that in the long run it&apos;s artistically a good idea. The worst thing you can be is estranged.&quot;</p><p>But her conscience is not entirely clear.</p><p>&quot;I do wonder and sometimes I don&apos;t sleep well. I think: &apos;What am I doing&apos;. Betraying a family member doesn&apos;t sit well with me at all, and I wonder if I am. It&apos;s a hard thing to do; it&apos;s not an easy thing to do.&quot;</p><p>While she hopes that those relationships can be mended, right now she&apos;s not ready to stop drawing. Her art is winning.</p><p>&quot;I can&apos;t give you any answers. Except that it&apos;s something I&apos;m feeling and did drawings about. I think that&apos;s important.&quot;</p><p><strong><em>Listen to the full episode of RN&apos;s new podcast <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/realthing/" target="_self" title="">The Real Thing</a> now.</em></strong></p>, tiny_mobile_url=, content_summary=[inline-photo], first_create_date=2016-09-27 01:21:14, web_url=http://abc.net.au/news/7880200, attached_video=[], tiny_web_url=http://ab.co/2cxASuU, extra=null, id=7880200, article_key=7880200.xml, byline=Mike Williams for The Real Thing, updated=2016-09-27 03:24:10, status=Usable}

Though it has been 30 years since she published a book, she continues to produce work that is unashamedly personal and political.</p><p>&quot;I didn&apos;t stop trying to get my work published, there wasn&apos;t that interest in my sort of stuff and that was fine. I guess I don&apos;t really have a huge ambition,&quot; says Mary Leunig.</p><p>But there are advantages to laying low.</p><p>&quot;The thing about not being published is that you are pretty free to do what you want. I&apos;m not doing this for anybody.&quot;</p><p>Mary is a self-described recluse. She lives on a quiet property in Merton, Victoria, overlooking the stunning Strathbogie Ranges.</p><p>&quot;I think I just wanted not to be known, to shut everything down and be left alone.&quot;</p><h4>The art of inspiring blood and guts</h4><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/corporate-gore/7880270"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880240-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A businessman stands impaled by a dozen spears in a cartoon by Mary Leunig" title="Corporate gore" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>Several radios blast the ABC from different corners of Mary&apos;s kitchen. It&apos;s an effort to combat the buzzing tinnitus in her ears, and the news provides inspiration for her craft.</p><p>Mary&apos;s shoulders are sore from hunching over the kitchen table. She looks through a giant magnifying glass to see the severed head she&apos;s brought to life &#x2014; or death, as the case may be.</p><p>She&apos;s at pains to point out that while her work is often politically charged, it just as often isn&apos;t. Once, a reviewer described her drawing of a woman in a swastika dress as a comment on the fascist nature of housework.</p><p>&quot;I just designed a swastika dress and wanted to put it in a picture,&quot; she says.</p><p>&quot;I refer to my work as drawing. If they&apos;re referred to as cartoons, there is the expectation that they have a meaning.&quot;</p><p>Growing up in the working-class western suburbs of Melbourne shaped both Mary and Michael. Their parents were employed at a local meatworks and their father was a union delegate.</p><p>Another strong theme in her work is women and power &#x2014; she describes herself as a radical feminist and likes to depict corporate figures naked or humiliated.</p><p>Blood and guts are a common thread. Sometimes subtle, but mostly confronting, her work isn&apos;t the sort of thing you&apos;d hang over your dinner table.</p><p>&quot;I enjoy the sort of work I do because it&apos;s not the sort of work that a nice woman or a nice lady should do. I do decapitations; I don&apos;t mind doing it, especially if it&apos;s Rupert Murdoch.<div class="inline-content wysiwyg right">

</div></p><p>&quot;In a way I&apos;m trying to encourage young girls out there at state school to draw as much blood and guts as you possibly can.&quot;</p><p>But don&apos;t expect to get your hands on a copy of a Mary Leunig original any time soon. She refuses to sell prints because &quot;she doesn&apos;t want to rob people&quot; and is reluctant to part with originals.</p><p>Someone wrote to her recently asking to purchase a drawing. She said she wouldn&apos;t know what to charge but would send him one for free.</p><p>&quot;He wrote back and asked me if I like salami. I&apos;m going to give him a drawing and he&apos;s going to send me salami&quot;.</p><h4>The Leunig experience</h4><p>The birth of Mary&apos;s first child was memorable, of course. She recalls being the same age as the midwife who looked after her. During the delivery she asked about one of Mary&apos;s brother&apos;s cartoons.</p><p>&quot;She goes through this whole f***ing poem of Michael&apos;s as I&apos;m giving birth,&quot; says Mary. &quot;She was gorgeous and she really wanted to know what it meant and she said: &apos;He must be wonderful.&apos;&quot;</p><p>Mary reckons it was just another &quot;Leunig experience&quot;.</p><p>Michael Leunig&apos;s cartoons, poems and calendars have appeared in newspapers for over 40 years. His success is something Mary and her family have enjoyed.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re very proud of Michael,&quot; she says. &quot;He&apos;s a really clever person. He&apos;s great with ideas, really humorous. So for all of us it was really wonderful&quot;.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/gough-whitlam-and-vincent-lingiari/7880264"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880244-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Gough Whitlam hands Vincent Lingiari a handful of soil in a cartoon by Mary Leunig" title="Gough Whitlam and Vincent Lingiari" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>But to avoid any bother with over-zealous Leunig fans, Mary often goes by &quot;Mary Baker&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m an artist &#x2014; I like artists and their process,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s ridiculous being jealous of Michael. His work&apos;s really good. I wouldn&apos;t even try to do what Michael does, I like what I do.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t understand this thing he&apos;s got about gentleness because he can be just as brutal as anyone. Maybe that&apos;s why he&apos;s all gentle in his work. And maybe I&apos;m really gentle and I draw decapitated heads. You&apos;re not necessarily about what you project.</p><p>&quot;There&apos;s a type of humour that we share sometimes, which is probably just a basic working class humour.&quot;</p><p>The Leunig name is now cemented in Australia art &#x2014; many other members of the family, including Michael&apos;s children, work in creative industries.</p><h4>Self-expression at a cost</h4><p>In the early 70s, Mary&apos;s parents moved from suburban Melbourne to a small Victorian town called Daylesford.</p><p>&quot;There was a dream I guess. We could move up there, gradually all my siblings could go up there, have kids, it would be an extended family, it would work,&quot; she says.</p><p>And that&apos;s what happened, for a while.</p><p>&quot;There was always something kind of wrong. It wasn&apos;t working out perfectly.&quot;</p><p>They began fighting and Mary stopped talking to certain members of her family, including her parents.</p><p>&quot;We became estranged and it was pretty terrible and there was nothing that could be done about it,&quot; she says. &quot;We still stayed there, and even though my parents lived just down the hill, there was no talking.&quot;</p><p>After her parents died she used art to help her express her feeling.</p><p>&quot;You just get so used to not communicating with that person that it becomes permanent,&quot; she says.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/family-life/7880328"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880326-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Mary Leunig and her children in a cartoon by Mary Leunig" title="Family life" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>Mary has had an off and on relationship with Michael. In an unfortunate turn of events, she&apos;s had less contact with her children, who are now in their 40s, in recent years. Arguments led both sides to stop talking.</p><p>&quot;I thought OK, that&apos;s alright. But then I did a few drawings involving my kids and they really disliked me for it.&quot;</p><p>But the drawings &#x2014; like the ones with her parents and Michael &#x2014; are Mary&apos;s way of dealing with family life and its ups and downs.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m inclined to think that for me to go a little bit public with my personal feelings about estrangement and maybe failure as a mother, I think that in the long run it&apos;s artistically a good idea. The worst thing you can be is estranged.&quot;</p><p>But her conscience is not entirely clear.</p><p>&quot;I do wonder and sometimes I don&apos;t sleep well. I think: &apos;What am I doing&apos;. Betraying a family member doesn&apos;t sit well with me at all, and I wonder if I am. It&apos;s a hard thing to do; it&apos;s not an easy thing to do.&quot;</p><p>While she hopes that those relationships can be mended, right now she&apos;s not ready to stop drawing. Her art is winning.</p><p>&quot;I can&apos;t give you any answers. Except that it&apos;s something I&apos;m feeling and did drawings about. I think that&apos;s important.&quot;</p><p><strong><em>Listen to the full episode of RN&apos;s new podcast <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/realthing/" target="_self" title="">The Real Thing</a> now.</em></strong></p>, tiny_mobile_url:, content_summary:[inline-photo], first_create_date:2016-09-27 01:21:14, web_url:http://abc.net.au/news/7880200, attached_video:[], tiny_web_url:http://ab.co/2cxASuU, extra:null, id:7880200, article_key:7880200.xml, byline:Mike Williams for The Real Thing, updated:2016-09-27 03:24:10, status:Usable]

</a></div><p> </p><p>The community space was the central focus of the design.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s the space that doesn&apos;t have any defined function or purpose really, it&apos;s just a meeting place,&quot; Mr Greenwood said.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s like a space you walk through to get to other parts of the building and other parts of the building enter into that space.&quot;</p><p>He also describes it as a non-monumental building that fits into its landscape.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;You can enter from the courtyard, there&apos;s no grand entries and you feel comfortable about arriving and exploring,&quot; Mr Greenwood said.</p></blockquote><p>To further add to the fluidity of the design, a series of courtyards and lack of fences adds to the &apos;openness&apos;.</p><h4>Australia&apos;s earliest known mosque</h4><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/the-mosque-at-maree/7878820"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7878786-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="The earliest known mosque in Australia was built in Maree in the South Australia outback built of mud walls and a thatched roof." title="The mosque at Maree" width="340" height="227">

His father played violin and I think there was a general fascination with the instrument,&quot; Stanley said.</p><p>&quot;[Our parents] were not musicians but they loved the violin and also they heard there was a really good violin teacher in the neighbourhood.&quot;</p><p>Both parents have travelled to Sydney for this rare family reunion concert.</p><p>&quot;We started them off very young because we always wanted them to put music on at least an equal footing with all of the other subjects, and they should start young and they should treat it seriously,&quot; Peter said.</p><p>&quot;It developed like fire and it developed very fast and so we were there for part of the journey anyway, we were there to help them wherever we could.&quot;</p><p>The Dodds children drove each other to succeed.</p><p>&quot;We were all one year apart and so there was sort of a flow on effect,&quot; Stanley said. &quot;I would usually do things first but then Dan would do it better and then they kept getting better as they went on.&quot;</p><p>Stanley, Daniel and Kyli each left Australia when they were just 17 years of age to study the violin in Switzerland.</p><p>&quot;For me, violin has always been something that has spoken to me,&quot; Daniel said. &quot;It has always been fascinating for me to express myself with the violin.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/stanley-dodds-conducting/7886202"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7886156-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Stanley Dodds conducting" title="Stanley Dodds conducting" width="340" height="227">

</a></div><p> </p><p>&quot;We&apos;re not asking anybody else to be interested in your postcards or letters &#x2014; we&apos;re asking you to be interested in your postcards or letters,&quot; Ms Lolicato told The Drawing Room.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re asking you to create the same kind of value ... you might see when you see a nice building out in the street or when you see a Greek vase or a painting in a museum or a gallery.</p><p>&quot;If we give these objects of our own everyday experience and of our ancestors&apos; the same reverence, we&apos;re able to use them as communication, we&apos;re able to use them as mechanisms for placing yourself through time and space.&quot;</p><p>The Foundling Archive was set up by Katrina Lolicato and her sister Gracie &#x2014; unashamed collectors of &quot;all things sentimental and nostalgic&quot;.</p><p>Ms Lolicato said they began by buying the personal items they saw in second-hand stores or on eBay.</p><p>&quot;I thought, &apos;You can&apos;t get rid of this! Surely it must have a meaning somewhere,&apos;&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;Beyond that, we&apos;ve started acquiring collections through people coming in contact with us.</p><p>&quot;They no longer see the relevance in what they&apos;ve acquired through somebody&apos;s passing or moving into a house and finding a stash under the floorboards or wherever.</p><p>&quot;I think that somewhere they see that they would rather not throw it in the garbage.&quot;</p><h4>A family situated in Australian society</h4><p>Ms Lolicato&apos;s favourite collection covers three generations of men, each named George Argo Turner, who each served in the military. The oldest fought on the western front in the First World War; his son fought in the Second World War, and his grandson in Vietnam.</p><p>&quot;We see media clippings, we see letters, training schedules from Puckapunyal, and all these amazing documents that they would have just thrown in a drawer,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;It really situates this family over nearly a century in Australian society &#x2014; not just on a fun, celebratory level, but also politically.&quot;</p><p>Ms Lolicato believes each of us can have a similar experience with those things we have accumulated throughout our lives.</p><p>&quot;The most precious thing that you have could be your granddad&apos;s cap, or it could be a sugar bowl, or it could be a photograph, it could be a letter,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;These objects place you in society, through time, in history, and on the Australian landscape. They enable you to ground yourself in where you&apos;re at, and position yourself so that you&apos;re better equipped to have empathy for other people.</p><p>&quot;Through our projects, we remind people of their mortality and their positioning in time &#x2014; and that they are a blip on the continuation of human existence.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/photograph-from-the-west-sydney-collection/7884362"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7884360-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A pair of black and white photographs depicting Sydney around the time of the Second World War." title="Photograph from the West Sydney Collection" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><h4>Love of collecting linked to migrant history</h4><p>For Daniella Trimboli, a researcher in diasporic cultures and digital storytelling, the exciting thing about the Foundling Archive is the way it extends Australia&apos;s immigration story beyond the dominant narrative.</p><p>&quot;These more everyday things enable us to see the complexities and differences that people actually experience in their day-to-day lives, that we wouldn&apos;t normally get an insight into,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s not &apos;you settle and you live a happy life&apos;. It&apos;s actually back and forth, memories and reconnections, new connections with other migrants and your community here.&quot;</p><p>Ms Lolicato said her own love of collecting was linked to her background as a member of the Italian diaspora.</p><p>&quot;When you don&apos;t have a longstanding history of being on the Australian landscape, when your family has come from somewhere else, what happens is they bring these trinkets with them,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;In the pre-digital age, when people were sending things through mail, the photographs and the letters that you got were so precious.</p><p>&quot;I think that I always felt a sense of reverence or respect or authority for those trinkets and other pieces of paper and photography because they were always discussed with me as something that represented something greater than the bit of paper they were written on.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/katrina-lolicato-at-the-launch-of-the-foundling-archive/7884690"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7884680-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A woman with dark hair speaks to two women wearing headscarves at an event opening." title="Katrina Lolicato at the launch of the Foundling Archive" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><h4>Digital age puts old artefacts in new context</h4><p>But the digital age puts these trinkets into a new context. Though you can still buy postcards, many families keep in touch by posting their holiday photos on Facebook instead. Home videos are more likely to exist in the cloud than on a VHS tape gathering dust on the mantelpiece.</p><p>&quot;Those time and space divides that made those objects so precious &#x2014; we don&apos;t have that; we can connect immediately,&quot; Ms Lolicato said.</p><p>&quot;We place different meanings now on those kinds of objects and those interactions as well.&quot;</p><p>Dr Trimboli said it enables new kinds of stories to be heard. And outside of the big capital city museums, a more nuanced story of Australian migration and multiculturalism can emerge.</p><p>&quot;When you start looking at the way that other people are taking on digital forms and creating their own kinds of stories, really interesting things start to happen,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;You pick up on all these other things that you didn&apos;t hear about before, and also it allows for different kinds of connections as well, because people find this space where they can relate to something that someone else has shared.</p><p>&quot;It just allows for a different kind of mediation that&apos;s not often seen through these bigger institutions.&quot;</p><p><strong><em>Listen to the full interview with Katrina Lolicato and Daniella Trimboli on The Drawing Room at 7:15pm on RN, or subscribe to the podcast on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/drawing-room-program-podcast/id644052724?mt=2" class="externalLink">iTunes</a>, the <a href="https://radio.abc.net.au/help/apps">ABC Radio</a> app or your favourite <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/feed/4658720/podcast.xml" target="_self" title="">podcasting app</a> to listen later.</em></strong></p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/photo-found-at-market-in-lygon-street/7884662"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7884648-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A photo found at the Lost and Found market in Lygon Street, Brunswick East, between April 2013 and September 2013." title="Photo found at market in Lygon Street" width="340" height="227">

</a></div><p> </p><p>&quot;We&apos;re not asking anybody else to be interested in your postcards or letters &#x2014; we&apos;re asking you to be interested in your postcards or letters,&quot; Ms Lolicato told The Drawing Room.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re asking you to create the same kind of value ... you might see when you see a nice building out in the street or when you see a Greek vase or a painting in a museum or a gallery.</p><p>&quot;If we give these objects of our own everyday experience and of our ancestors&apos; the same reverence, we&apos;re able to use them as communication, we&apos;re able to use them as mechanisms for placing yourself through time and space.&quot;</p><p>The Foundling Archive was set up by Katrina Lolicato and her sister Gracie &#x2014; unashamed collectors of &quot;all things sentimental and nostalgic&quot;.</p><p>Ms Lolicato said they began by buying the personal items they saw in second-hand stores or on eBay.</p><p>&quot;I thought, &apos;You can&apos;t get rid of this! Surely it must have a meaning somewhere,&apos;&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;Beyond that, we&apos;ve started acquiring collections through people coming in contact with us.</p><p>&quot;They no longer see the relevance in what they&apos;ve acquired through somebody&apos;s passing or moving into a house and finding a stash under the floorboards or wherever.</p><p>&quot;I think that somewhere they see that they would rather not throw it in the garbage.&quot;</p><h4>A family situated in Australian society</h4><p>Ms Lolicato&apos;s favourite collection covers three generations of men, each named George Argo Turner, who each served in the military. The oldest fought on the western front in the First World War; his son fought in the Second World War, and his grandson in Vietnam.</p><p>&quot;We see media clippings, we see letters, training schedules from Puckapunyal, and all these amazing documents that they would have just thrown in a drawer,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;It really situates this family over nearly a century in Australian society &#x2014; not just on a fun, celebratory level, but also politically.&quot;</p><p>Ms Lolicato believes each of us can have a similar experience with those things we have accumulated throughout our lives.</p><p>&quot;The most precious thing that you have could be your granddad&apos;s cap, or it could be a sugar bowl, or it could be a photograph, it could be a letter,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;These objects place you in society, through time, in history, and on the Australian landscape. They enable you to ground yourself in where you&apos;re at, and position yourself so that you&apos;re better equipped to have empathy for other people.</p><p>&quot;Through our projects, we remind people of their mortality and their positioning in time &#x2014; and that they are a blip on the continuation of human existence.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/photograph-from-the-west-sydney-collection/7884362"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7884360-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A pair of black and white photographs depicting Sydney around the time of the Second World War." title="Photograph from the West Sydney Collection" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><h4>Love of collecting linked to migrant history</h4><p>For Daniella Trimboli, a researcher in diasporic cultures and digital storytelling, the exciting thing about the Foundling Archive is the way it extends Australia&apos;s immigration story beyond the dominant narrative.</p><p>&quot;These more everyday things enable us to see the complexities and differences that people actually experience in their day-to-day lives, that we wouldn&apos;t normally get an insight into,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s not &apos;you settle and you live a happy life&apos;. It&apos;s actually back and forth, memories and reconnections, new connections with other migrants and your community here.&quot;</p><p>Ms Lolicato said her own love of collecting was linked to her background as a member of the Italian diaspora.</p><p>&quot;When you don&apos;t have a longstanding history of being on the Australian landscape, when your family has come from somewhere else, what happens is they bring these trinkets with them,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;In the pre-digital age, when people were sending things through mail, the photographs and the letters that you got were so precious.</p><p>&quot;I think that I always felt a sense of reverence or respect or authority for those trinkets and other pieces of paper and photography because they were always discussed with me as something that represented something greater than the bit of paper they were written on.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/katrina-lolicato-at-the-launch-of-the-foundling-archive/7884690"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7884680-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A woman with dark hair speaks to two women wearing headscarves at an event opening." title="Katrina Lolicato at the launch of the Foundling Archive" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><h4>Digital age puts old artefacts in new context</h4><p>But the digital age puts these trinkets into a new context. Though you can still buy postcards, many families keep in touch by posting their holiday photos on Facebook instead. Home videos are more likely to exist in the cloud than on a VHS tape gathering dust on the mantelpiece.</p><p>&quot;Those time and space divides that made those objects so precious &#x2014; we don&apos;t have that; we can connect immediately,&quot; Ms Lolicato said.</p><p>&quot;We place different meanings now on those kinds of objects and those interactions as well.&quot;</p><p>Dr Trimboli said it enables new kinds of stories to be heard. And outside of the big capital city museums, a more nuanced story of Australian migration and multiculturalism can emerge.</p><p>&quot;When you start looking at the way that other people are taking on digital forms and creating their own kinds of stories, really interesting things start to happen,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;You pick up on all these other things that you didn&apos;t hear about before, and also it allows for different kinds of connections as well, because people find this space where they can relate to something that someone else has shared.</p><p>&quot;It just allows for a different kind of mediation that&apos;s not often seen through these bigger institutions.&quot;</p><p><strong><em>Listen to the full interview with Katrina Lolicato and Daniella Trimboli on The Drawing Room at 7:15pm on RN, or subscribe to the podcast on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/drawing-room-program-podcast/id644052724?mt=2" class="externalLink">iTunes</a>, the <a href="https://radio.abc.net.au/help/apps">ABC Radio</a> app or your favourite <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/feed/4658720/podcast.xml" target="_self" title="">podcasting app</a> to listen later.</em></strong></p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/photo-found-at-market-in-lygon-street/7884662"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7884648-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A photo found at the Lost and Found market in Lygon Street, Brunswick East, between April 2013 and September 2013." title="Photo found at market in Lygon Street" width="340" height="227">

We&apos;d better go and put her in her place.&apos; Well, they tried to anyway.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content right"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/clementineford/posts/843723725704723:0" class="externalLink"><span><strong>External Link:</strong> Sunrise Facebook Post</span> </a></div><p> </p><p>And with that, the thousand bodies crammed into Melbourne&apos;s Athenaeum for the launch of Ford&apos;s book, Fight Like A Girl, doubled over laughing. </p><p>&quot;I have fought the odds to get here,&quot; Ford said.</p><p>&quot;Empowered by the knowledge that every single woman who has come before me has fought her own battle to survive. We fight like girls. This is how we prevail. And this is why we&apos;re still standing.&quot;</p><p>Ford spoke with Baird about whether feminism should make room for men, why women need to silence their inner critics, and how we can all stand up for ourselves online. </p><p><em>The following is an edited, condensed version of their conversation. </em></p><p><strong><em>Baird: What does it mean to &quot;fight like a girl&quot;? Do girls fight differently, is that what you&apos;re saying?</em></strong></p><p>Ford: Traditionally, to do anything like a girl &#x2026; is to be rubbish at it. Because girls are rubbish, and girls are pointless, and unless girls are servicing some other kind of patriarchal ideal, then what&apos;s the point of us at all? </p><p>It&apos;s that old quote &#x2014; I&apos;m paraphrasing it, but &#x2014; &quot;the rent we need to pay in order to have any kind of voice&quot;. And when I started to think more about that, I heard it instead as, &quot;well, if I [a man] have to listen to you, then you [a woman] have to give me something to at least look at&quot;.</p><p>So the idea that &quot;to fight like a girl&quot; is a play, not just on the fact that people think that girls are rubbish but &#x2026; is testament to how strong women are and how vigorously we fight just to exist day to day, with all of the violence that is enacted against us, with all of the hostility, the brutality. And we are still here and still standing. </p><p><strong><em>Just listening to you, I was thinking about the song during the depression about &quot;don&apos;t be polite, girls, show a little fight&quot;. The women of the Second Wave (of feminism) used to sing it, and their grandmothers had sung it to them. Every generation, it seems, needs to be told this message again. What is it that needs to be said now? </em></strong></p><p>There are multiple things that need to be said. But one of the primary things we all need to absorb is that liberation, for [women], won&apos;t happen by being polite. </p><p>It took me a long time to realise that being nice to men &#x2014; and when I say men I mean individual men, but also the structural dominance of patriarchy &#x2014; being nice to the system isn&apos;t going to get anything for women. Why would the system collapse itself just because women asked nicely? </p><p>So the analogy I often use is of a pond. If you are looking at a pond and you want to change the surface area of the pond, you&apos;re not going to do it by asking the pond nicely &#x2014; you do it by throwing a rock into the middle of the pond. And that&apos;s why I feel what, very simply, we have to do. </p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/clementine-ford-in-conversation-with-julia-baird/7880808"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880338-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Clementine Ford in conversation with Julia Baird at the Athenaeum, Melbourne on September 26, 2016." title="Clementine Ford in conversation with Julia Baird" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>I often have men wagging their fingers in my face and saying, &quot;Well, you&apos;ll never get men onside if you&apos;re not nice to them. How can you change men&apos;s minds if you&apos;re not nice to them?&quot;</p><p>But I don&apos;t give a f*** about men.

I don&apos;t f***ing care what men think about it. </p><p><strong><em>A lot of this book, it feels like, has been shaped in combat.

</a></div><p> </p><p>When [Jill] was found, it suddenly brought a sense of reality that this thing had happened to this woman, but then came the week of victim-blaming &#x2014; you know, articles about &quot;Why did she walk home that way?&quot; or &quot;Why did she walk home through Brunswick, through those derelict streets of dingy warehouses?&quot;</p><p>Adrian Bayley made the choice to rape and murder a woman. And if it hadn&apos;t been her, then it would have been someone else that night. </p><p>And that&apos;s fundamentally what it comes down to: realising that, when you say things to women like, &quot;Well, why did you walk down there, why did you dress this way?&quot;, that&apos;s taking the emphasis off the men who are choosing to do these things to women. </p><p>We need to be able to name those things and I think, for me, Jill Meagher&apos;s murder was really the turning point. I was so angry that women were still being told that these things were fundamentally our fault.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/a-woman-at-clem-ford&#x27;s-book-launch/7880988"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880356-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Women in the audience of Clementine Ford&#x27;s book launch in Melbourne." title="A woman at Clem Ford&#x27;s book launch" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p><strong><em>Was another turning point your Sunrise moment? That was a point of acceleration for you &#x2014; taking on the public shaming of women.</em></strong></p><p>I received so many cracker comments like, &quot;I&apos;ve seen better tits on a pit-bull&quot;. Someone told me that they hoped I would sit on a butcher&apos;s knife so I&apos;d never reproduce. </p><p>But I feel like I&apos;ve got such a thick skin about that stuff [online abuse] now that I just really don&apos;t care. I feel it keenly when I see men saying those things to other women &#x2014; it really upsets me and hurts me and I want to go in there and protect them &#x2014; but when they say it to me, I just know how to deal with it.</p><p>I know that it is not going to silence me or shut me up and if anything just makes me laugh at them.</p><p><strong><em>What do you think the huge response to that post was about? What is it about you publicly calling sexism out that women are responding to?</em></strong></p><p>Firstly, that someone is legitimising my own thoughts, that have always been framed to me as irrelevant or irrational or non-existent, that they might just be in my own head. But then here&apos;s this person saying the same things I think, and maybe I&apos;m not crazy. </p><div class="inline-content photo right"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/amy-schumer-stockholm-show/7881590"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7814410-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Amy Schumer at Stockholm show" title="Amy Schumer at Stockholm show" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>But also, just a sense of, &quot;Well, why do we have to put up with this bullshit all the time? Why do we have to sit there while men degrade and laugh at us, while we just sit there and laugh along?&quot;</p><p>Because if we don&apos;t laugh at the massive joke that is us, then we are being a buzz-kill, or a downer or a &quot;feminazi bitch&quot; or whatever. </p><p>I&apos;ve sat there and laughed so many times when men have told sexist jokes in front of me because I know that I&apos;m not supposed to say, &quot;hey, I don&apos;t think that it&apos;s funny&quot;. </p><p>I feel like it&apos;s gotten to the point where the more women we see saying, &quot;shut up&quot; or &quot;no, I&apos;m not going to tolerate that&quot;, the easier it is for us all to do. Seeing someone else say &quot;I don&apos;t like it&quot; helps make us feel big again. </p><p><strong><em>One question you get asked a lot by men is about what their role is [in feminism], and why don&apos;t you allow them a space. </em></strong></p><p>Once upon a time, I would have sat in a room full of people like this and said: &quot;Thank you to all of the men who came tonight, all five of you. It&apos;s so great to have you here, you&apos;re such great guys.&quot; </p><p>That is something that feminists are inclined towards doing. Because if we&apos;re not nice to men, if we don&apos;t create space for men in feminism, then they&apos;ll leave. </p><p>Men are not doing anything for feminism now in terms of dismantling the patriarchy, so I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to be a huge loss. </p><div class="inline-content right"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BK0IXaaBrPk/" class="externalLink"><span><strong>External Link:</strong> Melissa Wellham on Instagram</span> </a></div><p> </p><p><strong><em>What about in history? With suffrage, you had to persuade some men to vote it through. You had to have some blokes on side.</em></strong></p><p>That may be true, but I don&apos;t think we should make a big song and dance about it. Feminism still has to make room for so many different kinds of women before it concerns itself with making room for men. </p><p>If men want to be on board with feminism, that&apos;s great. But don&apos;t sit there and put your hands out for your medals and your cookies. </p><p>It&apos;s an impulse that we all have as humans to want to be rewarded for our generosity and kindness. But when we feel that, we need to engage with that feeling and stamp it down. </p><p>We need to resist that urge to want to be rewarded for doing the basic right thing. Because if we have to keep acknowledging and thanking men for giving us respect, if we have to keep thanking them and saying, &quot;it&apos;s so great that you&apos;re here, you&apos;re such a good guy&quot; &#x2026; at what point are we allowed to stop doing that?</p><p><strong><em>There does seem to be a preoccupation with how feminism makes men feel ... </em></strong></p><p>We are too preoccupied as a society with wondering what men think about everything. </p><p>What do men think about feminism?

How do we use our own eyes to look at the world?&quot;, which is a process I&apos;m still figuring out because those messages are so deeply engrained. </p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/the-audience-at-clementine-ford&#x27;s-book-launch/7880814"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880348-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="People in the audience at the launch of Clementine Ford&#x27;s book Fight Like A Girl hold up their copies." title="The audience at Clementine Ford&#x27;s book launch" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>You can know it intellectually, but it&apos;s really hard to divorce yourself from that little 10-year-old girl who learns that she&apos;s fat for the first time, or learns that other people think that she&apos;s fat and what that word [fat] means. </p><p>Women turn down opportunities for all kinds of reasons.

</div><p> </p><p>One of the great things that I see happening on the internet now is that it&apos;s enabled women to globally connect with each other.

We&apos;d better go and put her in her place.&apos; Well, they tried to anyway.&quot;</p><div class="inline-content right"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/clementineford/posts/843723725704723:0" class="externalLink"><span><strong>External Link:</strong> Sunrise Facebook Post</span> </a></div><p> </p><p>And with that, the thousand bodies crammed into Melbourne&apos;s Athenaeum for the launch of Ford&apos;s book, Fight Like A Girl, doubled over laughing. </p><p>&quot;I have fought the odds to get here,&quot; Ford said.</p><p>&quot;Empowered by the knowledge that every single woman who has come before me has fought her own battle to survive. We fight like girls. This is how we prevail. And this is why we&apos;re still standing.&quot;</p><p>Ford spoke with Baird about whether feminism should make room for men, why women need to silence their inner critics, and how we can all stand up for ourselves online. </p><p><em>The following is an edited, condensed version of their conversation. </em></p><p><strong><em>Baird: What does it mean to &quot;fight like a girl&quot;? Do girls fight differently, is that what you&apos;re saying?</em></strong></p><p>Ford: Traditionally, to do anything like a girl &#x2026; is to be rubbish at it. Because girls are rubbish, and girls are pointless, and unless girls are servicing some other kind of patriarchal ideal, then what&apos;s the point of us at all? </p><p>It&apos;s that old quote &#x2014; I&apos;m paraphrasing it, but &#x2014; &quot;the rent we need to pay in order to have any kind of voice&quot;. And when I started to think more about that, I heard it instead as, &quot;well, if I [a man] have to listen to you, then you [a woman] have to give me something to at least look at&quot;.</p><p>So the idea that &quot;to fight like a girl&quot; is a play, not just on the fact that people think that girls are rubbish but &#x2026; is testament to how strong women are and how vigorously we fight just to exist day to day, with all of the violence that is enacted against us, with all of the hostility, the brutality. And we are still here and still standing. </p><p><strong><em>Just listening to you, I was thinking about the song during the depression about &quot;don&apos;t be polite, girls, show a little fight&quot;. The women of the Second Wave (of feminism) used to sing it, and their grandmothers had sung it to them. Every generation, it seems, needs to be told this message again. What is it that needs to be said now? </em></strong></p><p>There are multiple things that need to be said. But one of the primary things we all need to absorb is that liberation, for [women], won&apos;t happen by being polite. </p><p>It took me a long time to realise that being nice to men &#x2014; and when I say men I mean individual men, but also the structural dominance of patriarchy &#x2014; being nice to the system isn&apos;t going to get anything for women. Why would the system collapse itself just because women asked nicely? </p><p>So the analogy I often use is of a pond. If you are looking at a pond and you want to change the surface area of the pond, you&apos;re not going to do it by asking the pond nicely &#x2014; you do it by throwing a rock into the middle of the pond. And that&apos;s why I feel what, very simply, we have to do. </p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/clementine-ford-in-conversation-with-julia-baird/7880808"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880338-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Clementine Ford in conversation with Julia Baird at the Athenaeum, Melbourne on September 26, 2016." title="Clementine Ford in conversation with Julia Baird" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>I often have men wagging their fingers in my face and saying, &quot;Well, you&apos;ll never get men onside if you&apos;re not nice to them. How can you change men&apos;s minds if you&apos;re not nice to them?&quot;</p><p>But I don&apos;t give a f*** about men. I&apos;m not trying to change men&apos;s minds, I&apos;m trying to talk to women. I write for women. and I think that&apos;s a beautiful thing to be proud of. I don&apos;t f***ing care what men think about it. </p><p><strong><em>A lot of this book, it feels like, has been shaped in combat. What was the first point at which you thought, &quot;I&apos;m in a fight and I&apos;m going to take this on&quot;?</em></strong></p><p>It&apos;s almost <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/conviction-inside-the-hunt-for-jill-meagher&#x27;s-killer/7864120" target="_self" title="">four years to the day that Jill Meagher was killed in Brunswick</a>. And not just for me, but I think for Melbourne, that was a huge turning point. </p><div class="inline-content photo right"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/poster-of-missing-abc-melbourne-employee-jill-meagher-on-septem/7881570"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/4277818-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="A poster of missing ABC employee Jill Meagher in Brunswick, Melbourne, on September 24, 2012.

</a></div><p> </p><p>When [Jill] was found, it suddenly brought a sense of reality that this thing had happened to this woman, but then came the week of victim-blaming &#x2014; you know, articles about &quot;Why did she walk home that way?&quot; or &quot;Why did she walk home through Brunswick, through those derelict streets of dingy warehouses?&quot;</p><p>Adrian Bayley made the choice to rape and murder a woman. And if it hadn&apos;t been her, then it would have been someone else that night. </p><p>And that&apos;s fundamentally what it comes down to: realising that, when you say things to women like, &quot;Well, why did you walk down there, why did you dress this way?&quot;, that&apos;s taking the emphasis off the men who are choosing to do these things to women. </p><p>We need to be able to name those things and I think, for me, Jill Meagher&apos;s murder was really the turning point. I was so angry that women were still being told that these things were fundamentally our fault.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/a-woman-at-clem-ford&#x27;s-book-launch/7880988"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880356-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Women in the audience of Clementine Ford&#x27;s book launch in Melbourne." title="A woman at Clem Ford&#x27;s book launch" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p><strong><em>Was another turning point your Sunrise moment? That was a point of acceleration for you &#x2014; taking on the public shaming of women.</em></strong></p><p>I received so many cracker comments like, &quot;I&apos;ve seen better tits on a pit-bull&quot;. Someone told me that they hoped I would sit on a butcher&apos;s knife so I&apos;d never reproduce. </p><p>But I feel like I&apos;ve got such a thick skin about that stuff [online abuse] now that I just really don&apos;t care. I feel it keenly when I see men saying those things to other women &#x2014; it really upsets me and hurts me and I want to go in there and protect them &#x2014; but when they say it to me, I just know how to deal with it.</p><p>I know that it is not going to silence me or shut me up and if anything just makes me laugh at them.</p><p><strong><em>What do you think the huge response to that post was about? What is it about you publicly calling sexism out that women are responding to?</em></strong></p><p>Firstly, that someone is legitimising my own thoughts, that have always been framed to me as irrelevant or irrational or non-existent, that they might just be in my own head. But then here&apos;s this person saying the same things I think, and maybe I&apos;m not crazy. </p><div class="inline-content photo right"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/amy-schumer-stockholm-show/7881590"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7814410-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Amy Schumer at Stockholm show" title="Amy Schumer at Stockholm show" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>But also, just a sense of, &quot;Well, why do we have to put up with this bullshit all the time? Why do we have to sit there while men degrade and laugh at us, while we just sit there and laugh along?&quot;</p><p>Because if we don&apos;t laugh at the massive joke that is us, then we are being a buzz-kill, or a downer or a &quot;feminazi bitch&quot; or whatever. </p><p>I&apos;ve sat there and laughed so many times when men have told sexist jokes in front of me because I know that I&apos;m not supposed to say, &quot;hey, I don&apos;t think that it&apos;s funny&quot;. </p><p>I feel like it&apos;s gotten to the point where the more women we see saying, &quot;shut up&quot; or &quot;no, I&apos;m not going to tolerate that&quot;, the easier it is for us all to do. Seeing someone else say &quot;I don&apos;t like it&quot; helps make us feel big again. </p><p><strong><em>One question you get asked a lot by men is about what their role is [in feminism], and why don&apos;t you allow them a space. </em></strong></p><p>Once upon a time, I would have sat in a room full of people like this and said: &quot;Thank you to all of the men who came tonight, all five of you. It&apos;s so great to have you here, you&apos;re such great guys.&quot; </p><p>That is something that feminists are inclined towards doing. Because if we&apos;re not nice to men, if we don&apos;t create space for men in feminism, then they&apos;ll leave. </p><p>Men are not doing anything for feminism now in terms of dismantling the patriarchy, so I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to be a huge loss. </p><div class="inline-content right"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BK0IXaaBrPk/" class="externalLink"><span><strong>External Link:</strong> Melissa Wellham on Instagram</span> </a></div><p> </p><p><strong><em>What about in history? With suffrage, you had to persuade some men to vote it through. You had to have some blokes on side.</em></strong></p><p>That may be true, but I don&apos;t think we should make a big song and dance about it. Feminism still has to make room for so many different kinds of women before it concerns itself with making room for men. </p><p>If men want to be on board with feminism, that&apos;s great. But don&apos;t sit there and put your hands out for your medals and your cookies. </p><p>It&apos;s an impulse that we all have as humans to want to be rewarded for our generosity and kindness. But when we feel that, we need to engage with that feeling and stamp it down. </p><p>We need to resist that urge to want to be rewarded for doing the basic right thing. Because if we have to keep acknowledging and thanking men for giving us respect, if we have to keep thanking them and saying, &quot;it&apos;s so great that you&apos;re here, you&apos;re such a good guy&quot; &#x2026; at what point are we allowed to stop doing that?</p><p><strong><em>There does seem to be a preoccupation with how feminism makes men feel ... </em></strong></p><p>We are too preoccupied as a society with wondering what men think about everything. </p><p>What do men think about feminism? What do men think about Ghostbusters? What do men think about my dress? What do men think about the fact that women paint their nails? What do men think about Hillary Clinton? </p><p>Who cares?! I don&apos;t care what men think, I really don&apos;t, and I feel like we all need to get to that point where we say: &quot;I will choose to care about this person&apos;s feelings, but I am not going to care about what men think generally about something.&quot;</p><p>Women and women&apos;s interests don&apos;t become legitimate when a man is suddenly paying attention to them. </p><div class="inline-content photo right"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/rosie-the-riveter/7881640"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/1890648-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Rosie the Riveter" title="Rosie the Riveter" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p><strong><em>Anne Summers says in the foreword to her book Damned Whores and God&apos;s Police that women have real internal battles to fight, that we need to reinvent new selves other than mother and wife. What do you think when you hear her say that we still haven&apos;t unknotted our own thinking?</em></strong></p><p>Women have been told for so long by other people what we are supposed to be. </p><p>We learn very early on to look at ourselves through the male gaze. And it&apos;s impossible to separate ourselves from that. I don&apos;t care if someone calls me fat, because firstly, I don&apos;t think there is anything wrong with being fat. </p><p>But I do still suffer from that conditioned idea of what my body is supposed to look like, to the point that I do feel self-conscious when I walk down the street. I do think, &quot;are people looking at me thinking that I&apos;m too fat to wear this?&quot; or whatever it might be. </p><p><strong><em>The other day I emailed a very prominent woman who has got several degrees </em></strong>&#x2014; <strong><em>she just smashes it out of the park professionally. And I said: &quot;Can you come on my show?&quot; And she said: &quot;I&apos;ve put on too much weight.&quot; These things are so powerful in preventing women from speaking.</em></strong></p><p>The better question, for me, is, &quot;How do we learn to see ourselves with our own eyes? How do we use our own eyes to look at the world?&quot;, which is a process I&apos;m still figuring out because those messages are so deeply engrained. </p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/the-audience-at-clementine-ford&#x27;s-book-launch/7880814"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880348-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="People in the audience at the launch of Clementine Ford&#x27;s book Fight Like A Girl hold up their copies." title="The audience at Clementine Ford&#x27;s book launch" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>You can know it intellectually, but it&apos;s really hard to divorce yourself from that little 10-year-old girl who learns that she&apos;s fat for the first time, or learns that other people think that she&apos;s fat and what that word [fat] means. </p><p>Women turn down opportunities for all kinds of reasons. And so we need to learn how to look at ourselves through different eyes and quiet those inner voices. We might not be able to get rid of them completely, but we need to figure out how to become stronger than it.</p><p><strong><em>You are a technological warrior, which I think is a new frontier. How do you think women should fight online?</em></strong></p><p>Don&apos;t give a f***. Just be brazen. Really, more than anything, understand that it&apos;s your space as well, and you&apos;re entitled to be there. We are all entitled to take up space. </p><p>Women are trained from early on to figuratively and literally avoid taking up too much room, but we need to do the opposite of that now, and to figure out how to take up as much room as possible. </p><div class="inline-content wysiwyg right">

</a></div><p> </p><p>But to avoid any bother with over-zealous Leunig fans, Mary often goes by &quot;Mary Baker&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m an artist &#x2014; I like artists and their process,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s ridiculous being jealous of Michael. His work&apos;s really good. I wouldn&apos;t even try to do what Michael does, I like what I do.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t understand this thing he&apos;s got about gentleness because he can be just as brutal as anyone. Maybe that&apos;s why he&apos;s all gentle in his work. And maybe I&apos;m really gentle and I draw decapitated heads. You&apos;re not necessarily about what you project.</p><p>&quot;There&apos;s a type of humour that we share sometimes, which is probably just a basic working class humour.&quot;</p><p>The Leunig name is now cemented in Australia art &#x2014; many other members of the family, including Michael&apos;s children, work in creative industries.</p><h4>Self-expression at a cost</h4><p>In the early 70s, Mary&apos;s parents moved from suburban Melbourne to a small Victorian town called Daylesford.</p><p>&quot;There was a dream I guess. We could move up there, gradually all my siblings could go up there, have kids, it would be an extended family, it would work,&quot; she says.</p><p>And that&apos;s what happened, for a while.</p><p>&quot;There was always something kind of wrong. It wasn&apos;t working out perfectly.&quot;</p><p>They began fighting and Mary stopped talking to certain members of her family, including her parents.</p><p>&quot;We became estranged and it was pretty terrible and there was nothing that could be done about it,&quot; she says. &quot;We still stayed there, and even though my parents lived just down the hill, there was no talking.&quot;</p><p>After her parents died she used art to help her express her feeling.</p><p>&quot;You just get so used to not communicating with that person that it becomes permanent,&quot; she says.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/family-life/7880328"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880326-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Mary Leunig and her children in a cartoon by Mary Leunig" title="Family life" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>Mary has had an off and on relationship with Michael. In an unfortunate turn of events, she&apos;s had less contact with her children, who are now in their 40s, in recent years. Arguments led both sides to stop talking.</p><p>&quot;I thought OK, that&apos;s alright. But then I did a few drawings involving my kids and they really disliked me for it.&quot;</p><p>But the drawings &#x2014; like the ones with her parents and Michael &#x2014; are Mary&apos;s way of dealing with family life and its ups and downs.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m inclined to think that for me to go a little bit public with my personal feelings about estrangement and maybe failure as a mother, I think that in the long run it&apos;s artistically a good idea. The worst thing you can be is estranged.&quot;</p><p>But her conscience is not entirely clear.</p><p>&quot;I do wonder and sometimes I don&apos;t sleep well. I think: &apos;What am I doing&apos;. Betraying a family member doesn&apos;t sit well with me at all, and I wonder if I am. It&apos;s a hard thing to do; it&apos;s not an easy thing to do.&quot;</p><p>While she hopes that those relationships can be mended, right now she&apos;s not ready to stop drawing. Her art is winning.</p><p>&quot;I can&apos;t give you any answers. Except that it&apos;s something I&apos;m feeling and did drawings about. I think that&apos;s important.&quot;</p><p><strong><em>Listen to the full episode of RN&apos;s new podcast <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/realthing/" target="_self" title="">The Real Thing</a> now.</em></strong></p>, tiny_mobile_url=, content_summary=[inline-photo], first_create_date=2016-09-27 01:21:14, web_url=http://abc.net.au/news/7880200, attached_video=[], tiny_web_url=http://ab.co/2cxASuU, extra=null, id=7880200, article_key=7880200.xml, byline=Mike Williams for The Real Thing, updated=2016-09-27 03:24:10, status=Usable}

We could move up there, gradually all my siblings could go up there, have kids, it would be an extended family, it would work,&quot; she says.</p><p>And that&apos;s what happened, for a while.</p><p>&quot;There was always something kind of wrong. It wasn&apos;t working out perfectly.&quot;</p><p>They began fighting and Mary stopped talking to certain members of her family, including her parents.</p><p>&quot;We became estranged and it was pretty terrible and there was nothing that could be done about it,&quot; she says. &quot;We still stayed there, and even though my parents lived just down the hill, there was no talking.&quot;</p><p>After her parents died she used art to help her express her feeling.</p><p>&quot;You just get so used to not communicating with that person that it becomes permanent,&quot; she says.</p><div class="inline-content photo full"> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-27/family-life/7880328"> <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7880326-3x2-340x227.jpg" alt="Mary Leunig and her children in a cartoon by Mary Leunig" title="Family life" width="340" height="227">
</a></div><p> </p><p>Mary has had an off and on relationship with Michael. In an unfortunate turn of events, she&apos;s had less contact with her children, who are now in their 40s, in recent years. Arguments led both sides to stop talking.</p><p>&quot;I thought OK, that&apos;s alright. But then I did a few drawings involving my kids and they really disliked me for it.&quot;</p><p>But the drawings &#x2014; like the ones with her parents and Michael &#x2014; are Mary&apos;s way of dealing with family life and its ups and downs.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m inclined to think that for me to go a little bit public with my personal feelings about estrangement and maybe failure as a mother, I think that in the long run it&apos;s artistically a good idea. The worst thing you can be is estranged.&quot;</p><p>But her conscience is not entirely clear.</p><p>&quot;I do wonder and sometimes I don&apos;t sleep well. I think: &apos;What am I doing&apos;. Betraying a family member doesn&apos;t sit well with me at all, and I wonder if I am. It&apos;s a hard thing to do; it&apos;s not an easy thing to do.&quot;</p><p>While she hopes that those relationships can be mended, right now she&apos;s not ready to stop drawing. Her art is winning.</p><p>&quot;I can&apos;t give you any answers. Except that it&apos;s something I&apos;m feeling and did drawings about. I think that&apos;s important.&quot;</p><p><strong><em>Listen to the full episode of RN&apos;s new podcast <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/realthing/" target="_self" title="">The Real Thing</a> now.</em></strong></p>, tiny_mobile_url:, content_summary:[inline-photo], first_create_date:2016-09-27 01:21:14, web_url:http://abc.net.au/news/7880200, attached_video:[], tiny_web_url:http://ab.co/2cxASuU, extra:null, id:7880200, article_key:7880200.xml, byline:Mike Williams for The Real Thing, updated:2016-09-27 03:24:10, status:Usable]

Their third studio effort chronicles the dizzying highs of a massive year of sold out shows and festival slots both at home and abroad. But it was also a worrying 12 months of lows rough enough that it nearly saw the band split up.</p> <p>&quot;<i>Last year there was a stage where we came pretty close to hitting rock bottom</i>,&quot; Stickies bassist Paddy Cornwall told <b>Richard Kingsmill</b> on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/kingsmill/"><i>2016</i> this week</a>.</p> <p>&quot;<i>We&apos;re a dramatic band as well sometimes... probably all [self-destructive] in a certain different way</i>.&quot;</p> <br>Guitarist Seamus Coyle elaborated further on the day that StiFi (*nearly*) died.<p>&quot;<i>It was really close. There was one moment, when we were just about to get our visas to America and we almost didn&apos;t get there; the whole tour was about to be cancelled.</i>&quot;</p> <p>Long story short: some lucky last-minute string pulling got them over the line, into the States and &quot;<i>Bish bash bosh - we hit the road and forgot all the crap and got on with it.</i>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<i>That was the problem... It had been too long since we&apos;d done what we love doing, which is playing shows [and] being on the road together. We were just bickering and talking all this shit. But then actually got to America and to our surprise had a fanbase over there... selling out shows around the country. Next thing, we&apos;re all really happy again: &apos;love you guys&apos;!</i>&quot;</p> <p>Renewed, the band <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4494387.htm">headed to Thailand</a> to record with producer Dann Hume, fuelling their tales of rehab, breakups, loneliness, and other meltdowns into the new album, placing them side-by-side with their triumphs.

Gill Bates</h3></p> <br>Fresh from production credits on <b>Mallrat</b>&apos;s <i>Uninvited</i> EP, Adelaide native Tigerilla joins forces with Brisbane MC Gill Bates for this delightfully off-beat electro-rap joint.

These are the sets you cannot miss.</p> <p><h3>Tash Sultana and Friends</h3>Don&apos;t sleep on the early part of the Listen Out day. Those quiet first couple of hours are stacked with the best talent of the fest, and *coincidentally* all the female acts on the bill. After you catch <b>JOY.</b>, whose phenomenal debut mixtape speaks for itself, whip over to mystical stage dominators <b>Willow Beats</b>, the flawless <b>Ngaiire</b>, then don&apos;t miss <b>Tash Sultana</b>. </p> <p>The rising former-busker has the voice of an angel and plays every instrument under the sun herself, from the electric mandolin to the pan flute. Her show is packed with energy, focus and intrigue as she live-loops instruments you&apos;ve likely only seen in history textbooks. She enchanted punters with her sublime vocals and can shred an electric guitar like a metal veteran. Believe the hype.</p> <p><img src=" http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/img/tash-400.jpg"></p> <p><h3>Anderson .Paaking it in</h3>We all know how busy <b>Anderson .Paak</b> is. From <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4454809.htm">guesting on everyone&apos;s singles</a> to working with mate <b>Knxwledge</b> in <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4542043.htm">NxWorries</a>, it&apos;s amazing that he has the energy to bring a lively and superb show. Repping gold from his second full-length <i>Malibu</i>, Paak brought his full band, the Free Nationals over to pump out tight, funk and jazz-infused beats. </p> <p>Hip-hop shows are made spectacular with live instrumentation, as <b>Childish Gambino</b>&apos;s stellar set proved last year, and Paak gets the most out of his band, even jumping on the kit himself for a few. His range was astounding, jumping around for the explosive &apos;Am I Wrong&apos;, before getting on the kit for a stripped back telling of the story behind &apos;Carry Me&apos;, an arresting slice of beat poetry about a six-year-old Anderson begging his mum for his first pair of Jordans.</p> <p><img src=" http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/img/anderson-lyrics.jpg"></p> <p><h3>Hour of Baauer power</h3>While <b>Baauer</b> would probably rather forget his viral banger &apos;Harlem Shake&apos;, the track cemented him as a bonafide hype-lord. If you love drops, drops and more drops, the Philly producer&apos;s set is unmissable. He bangs hard, with a few top remixes, and his own gear that shifts and melds so perfectly, it&apos;s just one borderless dance party. While he may be on a little early for his material, there were no complaints from the rapturous rave before him. </p> <p><h3>Totally R&#xDC;F&#xDC;S</h3>The boys from <b>R&#xDC;F&#xDC;S</b> are in top form right now. About to wrap up their Australian tour, Tyrone, Jon and James are primed for world domination. The set touts material from stunning second album <i>Bloom</i>, including the meandering epic &apos;Innerbloom&apos;.

These are the sets you cannot miss.</p> <p><h3>Tash Sultana and Friends</h3>Don&apos;t sleep on the early part of the Listen Out day. Those quiet first couple of hours are stacked with the best talent of the fest, and *coincidentally* all the female acts on the bill. After you catch <b>JOY.</b>, whose phenomenal debut mixtape speaks for itself, whip over to mystical stage dominators <b>Willow Beats</b>, the flawless <b>Ngaiire</b>, then don&apos;t miss <b>Tash Sultana</b>. </p> <p>The rising former-busker has the voice of an angel and plays every instrument under the sun herself, from the electric mandolin to the pan flute. Her show is packed with energy, focus and intrigue as she live-loops instruments you&apos;ve likely only seen in history textbooks. She enchanted punters with her sublime vocals and can shred an electric guitar like a metal veteran. Believe the hype.</p> <p><img src=" http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/img/tash-400.jpg"></p> <p><h3>Anderson .Paaking it in</h3>We all know how busy <b>Anderson .Paak</b> is. From <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4454809.htm">guesting on everyone&apos;s singles</a> to working with mate <b>Knxwledge</b> in <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4542043.htm">NxWorries</a>, it&apos;s amazing that he has the energy to bring a lively and superb show. Repping gold from his second full-length <i>Malibu</i>, Paak brought his full band, the Free Nationals over to pump out tight, funk and jazz-infused beats. </p> <p>Hip-hop shows are made spectacular with live instrumentation, as <b>Childish Gambino</b>&apos;s stellar set proved last year, and Paak gets the most out of his band, even jumping on the kit himself for a few. His range was astounding, jumping around for the explosive &apos;Am I Wrong&apos;, before getting on the kit for a stripped back telling of the story behind &apos;Carry Me&apos;, an arresting slice of beat poetry about a six-year-old Anderson begging his mum for his first pair of Jordans.</p> <p><img src=" http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/img/anderson-lyrics.jpg"></p> <p><h3>Hour of Baauer power</h3>While <b>Baauer</b> would probably rather forget his viral banger &apos;Harlem Shake&apos;, the track cemented him as a bonafide hype-lord. If you love drops, drops and more drops, the Philly producer&apos;s set is unmissable. He bangs hard, with a few top remixes, and his own gear that shifts and melds so perfectly, it&apos;s just one borderless dance party. While he may be on a little early for his material, there were no complaints from the rapturous rave before him. </p> <p><h3>Totally R&#xDC;F&#xDC;S</h3>The boys from <b>R&#xDC;F&#xDC;S</b> are in top form right now. About to wrap up their Australian tour, Tyrone, Jon and James are primed for world domination. The set touts material from stunning second album <i>Bloom</i>, including the meandering epic &apos;Innerbloom&apos;. The guys dedicated the track to a late friend, playing as purple lights caught the Melbourne rain like falling petals, bringing the crowd of thousands to a serene stand-still. The boys lit up the Atari Stage with their growing list of dance staples, the crowd revelling in the energy of &apos;Like An Animal&apos; and &apos;You Were Right&apos;. They produced an electric atmosphere, magnetic and engaging no matter where you were standing.</p> <p><img src=" http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/img/rufus-listenout-400.jpg"></p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p><img src=" http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/img/2blessed-400.jpg"></p> <p><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-version="7" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:33.3333333333% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div> <p style=" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BKu_1yhgKtG/" style=" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;" target="_blank" class="externalLink">Praise be to the trap lord @asapferg &#x1F64F; #ListenOut2016 (&#x1F4F7; @schweppsrocka)</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A photo posted by triple j (@triple_j) on </p></div></blockquote> </p>, tiny_mobile_url:, content_summary:[], first_create_date:2016-09-25 14:00:00, web_url:http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4545852.htm, attached_video:[], tiny_web_url:http://ab.co/2dllKXH, extra:null, id:4545852, article_key:4545852.xml, byline:, updated:2016-09-26 07:19:00, status:Usable]
